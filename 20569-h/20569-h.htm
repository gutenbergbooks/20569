<h4>Dulcibel Burton.</h4>
<p>In the afternoon of a sunny Autumn day,
nearly two hundred years ago, a young man was walking along one of
the newly opened roads which led into Salem village, or what is now
called Danvers Centre, in the then Province of Massachusetts
Bay.</p>
<p>The town of Salem, that which is now the
widely known city of that name, lay between four and five miles to
the southeast, on a tongue of land formed by two inlets of the sea,
called now as then North and South Rivers. Next to Plymouth it is
the oldest town in New England, having been first settled in 1626.
Not till three years after were Boston and Charlestown commenced by
the arrival of eleven ships from England. It is a significant fact,
as showing the hardships to which the early settlers were exposed,
that of the fifteen hundred persons composing this Boston
expedition, two hundred died during the first winter. Salem has
also the honor of establishing the first New England church
organization, in 1629, with the Reverend Francis Higginson as its
pastor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg
2]</a></span></p>
<p>Salem village was an adjunct of Salem, the
town taking in the adjacent lands for the purpose of tillage to a
distance of six miles from the meeting-house. But in the progress
of settlement, Salem village also became entitled to a church of
its own; and it had one regularly established at the date of our
story, with the Reverend Samuel Parris as presiding elder or
minister.</p>
<p>There had been many bickerings and disputes
before a minister could be found acceptable to all in Salem
village. And the present minister was by no means a universal
favorite. The principal point of contention on his part was the
parsonage and its adjacent two acres of ground. Master Parris
claimed that the church had voted him a free gift of these; while
his opponents not only denied that it had been done, but that it
lawfully could be done. This latter view was undoubtedly correct;
for the parsonage land was a gift to the church, for the perpetual
use of its pastor, whosoever he might be. But Master Parris would
not listen to reason on this subject, and was not inclined to look
kindly upon the men who steadfastly opposed him.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Salem village were a
goodly as well as godly people, but owing to these
church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg
3]</a></span> differences about their ministers, as well as other
disputes and lawsuits relative to the bounds of their respective
properties, there was no little amount of ill feeling among them.
Small causes in a village are just as effective as larger ones in a
nation, in producing discord and strife; and the Puritans as a
people were distinguished by all that determination to insist upon
their rights, and that scorn of compromising difficulties, which
men of earnest and honest but narrow natures have manifested in all
ages of the world. Selfishness and uncharitableness are never so
dangerous as when they assume the character of a conscientious
devotion to the just and the true.</p>
<p>But all this time the young man has been
walking almost due north from the meeting house in Salem
village.</p>
<p>The road was not what would be called a good
one in these days, for it was not much more than a bridle-path; the
riding being generally at that time on horseback. But it was not
the rather broken and uneven condition of the path which caused the
frown on the young pedestrian's face, or the irritability shown by
the sharp slashes of the maple switch in his hand upon the aspiring
weeds along the roadside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id=
"Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>"If ever mortal man was so bothered," he
muttered at last, coming to a stop. "Of course she is the best
match, the other is below me, and has a spice of Satan in her; but
then she makes the blood stir in a man. Ha!"</p>
<p>This exclamation came as he lifted his eyes
from the ground, and gazed up the road before him. There, about
half a mile distant, was a young woman riding toward him. Then she
stopped her horse under a tree, and evidently was trying to break
off a switch, while her horse pranced around in a most excited
fashion. The horse at last starts in a rapid gallop. The young man
sees that in trying to get the switch, she has allowed the bridle
to get loose and over the horse's head, and can no longer control
the fiery animal. Down the road towards him she comes in a sharp
gallop, striving to stop the animal with her voice, evidently not
the least frightened, but holding on to the pommel of the saddle
with one hand while she makes desperate grasps at the hanging rein
with the other.</p>
<p>The young Puritan smiled, he took in the
situation with a glance, and felt no fear for her but rather
amusement. He was on the top of a steep hill, and he knew he could
easily stop the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id=
"Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> horse as it came up; even if she did not
succeed in regaining her bridle, owing to the better chances the
hill gave her.</p>
<p>"She is plucky, anyhow, if she is rather a
tame wench," said he, as the girl grasped the bridle rein at last,
when about half way up the hill, and became again mistress of the
blooded creature beneath her.</p>
<p>"Is that the way you generally ride,
Dulcibel?" asked the young man smiling.</p>
<p>"It all comes from starting without my riding
whip," replied the girl. "Oh, do stop!" she continued to the horse
who now on the level again, began sidling and curveting.</p>
<p>"Give me that switch of yours, Jethro. Now,
you shall see a miracle."</p>
<p>No sooner was the switch in her hand, than
the aspect and behavior of the animal changed as if by magic. You
might have thought the little mare had been raised in the enclosure
of a Quaker meeting-house, so sober and docile did she
seem.</p>
<p>"It is always so," said the girl laughing.
"The little witch knows at once whether I have a whip with me or
not, and acts accordingly. No, I will not forgive you," and she
gave the horse two or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id=
"Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> three sharp cuts, which it took like a
martyr. "Oh, I wish you would misbehave a little now; I should like
to punish you severely."</p>
<p>They made a very pretty picture, the little
jet-black mare, and the mistress with her scarlet paragon bodice,
even if the latter was entirely too pronounced for the taste of the
great majority of the inhabitants, young and old, of Salem
village.</p>
<p>"But how do you happen to be here?" said the
girl.</p>
<p>"I called to see you, and found you had gone
on a visit to Joseph Putnam's. So I thought I would walk up the
road and meet you coming back."</p>
<p>"What a sweet creature Mistress Putnam is,
and both so young for man and wife."</p>
<p>"Yes, Jo married early, but he is big enough
and strong enough, don't you think so?"</p>
<p>"He is a worshiped man indeed. Have you met
the stranger yet?"</p>
<p>"That Ellis Raymond? No, but I hear he is
something of a popinjay in his attire, and swelled up with the
conceit that he is better than any of us colonists."</p>
<p>"I do not think so," and the girl's cheek
colored a deeper red. "He seems to be a very<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> modest
young man indeed. I liked him very much."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, I have not seen him yet. But they
say his father was a son of Belial, and fought under the tyrant at
Naseby."</p>
<p>"But that is all over and his widowed mother
is one of us."</p>
<p>"Hang him, what does it matter!" Then,
changing his tone, and looking at her a little suspiciously. "Did
Leah Herrick say anything to you against me the other night at the
husking?"</p>
<p>"I do not allow people to talk to me against
my friends," replied she earnestly.</p>
<p>"She was talking to you a long time I
saw."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"It must have been an interesting
subject."</p>
<p>"It was rather an unpleasant one to
me."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"She wanted me to join the 'circle' which
they have just started at the minister's house. She says that old
Tituba has promised to show them how the Indians of Barbados
conjure and powwow, and that it will be great sport for the winter
nights."</p>
<p>"What did you say to it?"</p>
<p>"I told her I would have nothing to do
with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg
8]</a></span> such things; that I had no liking for them, and that
I thought it was wrong to tamper with such matters."</p>
<p>"That was all she said to you?" and the young
man seemed to breathe more freely.</p>
<p>The girl was sharp-witted&mdash;what girl is
not so in all affairs of the heart?&mdash;and it was now her turn.
"Leah is very handsome," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;everybody says so," he replied
coolly, as if it were a fact of very little importance to him, and
a matter which he had thought very little about.</p>
<p>Dulcibel, was not one to aim all around the
remark; she came at once, simply and directly to the
point.</p>
<p>"Did you ever pay her any
attentions?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, not to speak of. What made you think
of such an absurd thing?"</p>
<p>"'Not to speak of'&mdash;what do you
mean?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I kept company with her for
awhile&mdash;before you came to Salem&mdash;when we were merely boy
and girl."</p>
<p>"There never was any troth plighted between
you?"</p>
<p>"How foolish you are, Dulcibel! What has
started you off on this track?"<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yourself. Answer me plainly. Was there ever
any love compact between you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, pshaw! what nonsense all this
is!"</p>
<p>"If you do not answer me, I shall ask her
this very evening."</p>
<p>"Of course there was nothing between
us&mdash;nothing of any account&mdash;only a boy and girl
affair&mdash;calling her my little wife, and that kind of
nonsense."</p>
<p>"I think that a great deal. Did that continue
up to the time I came to the village?"</p>
<p>"How seriously you take it all! Remember, I
have your promise, Dulcibel."</p>
<p>"A promise on a promise is no
promise&mdash;every girl knows that. If you do not answer me fully
and truly, Jethro, I shall ask Leah."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the young man desperately "there
was a kind of childish troth up to that time, but it was, as I
said, a mere boy and girl affair."</p>
<p>"Boy and girl! You were eighteen, Jethro; and
she sixteen nearly as old as Joseph Putnam and his wife were when
they married."</p>
<p>"I do not care. I will not be bound by it;
and Leah knows it."</p>
<p>"You acted unfairly toward me, Jethro.
Leah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg
10]</a></span> has the prior right. I recall my troth. I will not
marry you without her consent."</p>
<p>"You will not!" said the young man
passionately&mdash;for well he knew that Leah's consent would never
be given.</p>
<p>"No, I will not!"</p>
<p>"Then take your troth back in welcome. In
truth, I met you here this day to tell you that. I love Leah
Herrick's little finger better than your whole body with your
Jezebel's bodice, and your fine lady's airs. You had better go now
and marry that conceited popinjay up at Jo Putnam's, if you can get
him."</p>
<p>With that he pushed off down the hill, and up
the road, that he might not be forced to accompany her back to the
village.</p>
<p>Dulcibel was not prepared for such a burst of
wrath, and such an uncovering of the heart. Which of us has not
been struck with wonder, even far more than indignation, at such
times? A sudden difference occurs, and the man or the woman in whom
you have had faith, and whom you have believed noble and admirable,
suddenly appears what he or she really is, a very common and vulgar
nature. It makes us sick at heart that we could have been so
deceived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg
11]</a></span></p>
<p>Such was the effect upon Dulcibel. What a
chasm she had escaped. To think she had really agreed to marry such
a spirit as that! But fortunately it was now all over.</p>
<p>She not only had lost a lover, but a friend.
And one day before, this also would have had its unpleasant side to
her. But now she felt even a sensation of relief. Was it because
this very day a new vision had entered into the charmed circle of
her life? If it were so, she did not acknowledge the fact to
herself; or even wonder in her own mind, why the sudden breaking of
her troth-plight had not left her in a sadder humor. For she put
"Little Witch" into a brisk canter, and with a smile upon her face
rode into the main street of the village.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id=

<h4>In Which Some Necessary Information is
Given.</h4>
<p>Dulcibel Burton was an orphan. Her father
becoming a little unsound in doctrine, and being greatly pleased
with the larger liberty of conscience offered by William Penn to
his colonists in Pennsylvania, had leased his house and lands to a
farmer by the name of Buckley, and departed for Philadelphia. This
was some ten years previous to the opening of our story. After
living happily in Philadelphia for about eight years he died
suddenly, and his wife decided to return to her old home in Salem
village, having arranged to board with Goodman Buckley, whose lease
had not yet expired. But in the course of the following winter she
also died, leaving this only child, Dulcibel, now a beautiful girl
of eighteen years. Dulcibel, as was natural, went on living with
the Buckleys, who had no children of their own, and were very
good-hearted and affectionate people.</p>
<p>Dulcibel therefore was an heiress, in a not
very large way, besides having wealthy relatives in<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
England, from some of whom in the course of years more or less
might reasonably be expected. And as our Puritan ancestors were by
no means blind to their worldly interests, believing that godliness
had the promise of this world as well as that which is to
come&mdash;the bereaved maiden became quite an object of interest
to the young men of the vicinity.</p>
<p>I have called her beautiful, and not without
good reason. With the old manuscript volume&mdash;a family heirloom
of some Quaker friends of mine&mdash;from which I have drawn the
facts of this narrative, came also an old miniature, the work of a
well-known English artist of that period. The colors have faded
considerably, but the general contour and the features are well
preserved. The face is oval, with a rather higher and fuller
forehead than usual; the hair, which was evidently of a rather
light brown, being parted in the center, and brought down with a
little variation from the strict Madonna fashion. The eyes are
large, and blue. The lips rather full. A snood or fillet of blue
ribbon confined her luxuriant hair. In form she was rather above
the usual height of women, and slender as became her age; though
with a perceptible tendency towards greater fullness with
increasing years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id=
"Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>There is rather curiously a great resemblance
between this miniature, and a picture I have in my possession of
the first wife of a celebrated New England poet. He himself being
named for one of the Judges who sat in the Special Court appointed
for the trial of the alleged witches, it would be curious if the
beautiful and angelic wife of his youth were allied by blood to one
of those who had the misfortune to come under the ban of
witchcraft.</p>
<p>Being both beautiful and an heiress, Dulcibel
naturally attracted the attention of her near neighbor in the
village, Jethro Sands. Jethro was quite a handsome young man after
a certain style, though, as his life proved, narrow minded,
vindictive and avaricious. Still he had a high reputation as a
young man with the elders of the village; for he had early seen how
advantageous it was to have a good standing in the church, and was
very orthodox in his faith, and very regular in his attendance at
all the church services. Besides, he was a staunch champion of the
Reverend Mr. Parris in all his difficulties with the parish, and in
return was invariably spoken of by the minister as one of the most
promising young men in that neighborhood.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
15]</a></span></p>
<p>Jethro resided with his aunt, the widow
Sands. She inherited from her husband the whole of his property.
His deed for the land narrated that the boundary line ran "from an
old dry stump, due south, to the southwest corner of his hog-pen,
then east by southerly to the top of the hill near a little pond,
then north by west to the highway side, and thence along the
highway to the old dry stump again aforesaid." There is a tradition
in the village that by an adroit removal of his hog-pen to another
location, and the uprooting and transplanting of the old dry stump,
at a time when nobody seemed to take a very active interest in the
adjoining land, owing to its title being disputed in successive
lawsuits, Jethro, who inherited at the death of his aunt, became
the possessor of a large tract of land that did not originally
belong to him. But then such stories are apt to crop up after the
death of every man who has acquired the reputation of being crafty
and close in his dealings.</p>
<p>We left Jethro, after his interview with
Dulcibel, walking on in order that he might avoid her further
company. After going a short distance he turned and saw that she
was riding rapidly homeward. Then he began to retrace his
steps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg
16]</a></span></p>
<p>"It was bound to come," he muttered. "I have
seen she was getting cold and thought it was Leah's work, but it
seems she was true to her promise after all. Well, Leah is poor,
and not of so good a family, but she is worth a dozen of such as
Dulcibel Burton."</p>
<p>Then after some minutes' silent striding, "I
hate her though for it, all the same. Everybody will know she has
thrown me off. But nobody shall get ahead of Jethro Sands in the
long run. I'll make her sorry for it before she dies, the spoiled
brat of a Quaker infidel!"</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id=

<h4>The Circle in the Minister's
House.</h4>
<p>It would, perhaps be unfair to hold the
Reverend Master Parris responsible for the wild doings that went on
in the parsonage house during the winter evenings of 1691-2, in the
face of his solemn assertion, made several years afterwards, that
he was ignorant of them. And yet, how could such things have been
without the knowledge either of himself or his wife? Mistress
Parris has come down to us with the reputation of a kindly and
discreet woman&mdash;nothing having been said to her discredit, so
far as I am aware, even by those who had a bitter controversy with
her husband. And yet she certainly must have known of the doings of
the famous "circle," even if she refrained from speaking of them to
her husband.</p>
<p>At the very bottom of the whole thing,
perhaps, were the West Indian slaves&mdash;"John Indias" and his
wife Tituba, whom Master Parris had brought with him from Barbados.
There were two children in the house, a little daughter of nine,
named Elizabeth; and Abigail Williams,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> three
years older. These very probably, Tituba often had sought to
impress, as is the manner of negro servants, with tales of
witchcraft, the "evil-eye" and "evil hand" spirits, powwowing, etc.
Ann Putnam, another precocious child of twelve, the daughter of a
near neighbor, Sergeant Putnam, the parish clerk, also was soon
drawn into the knowledge of the savage mysteries. And, before very
long, a regular "circle" of these and older girls was formed for
the purpose of amusing and startling themselves with the
investigation and performance of forbidden things.</p>
<p>At the present day this would not be so
reprehensible. We are comparatively an unbelieving generation; and
what are called "spiritual circles" are common, though not always
unattended with mischievous results. But at that time when it was
considered a deadly sin to seek intercourse with those who claimed
to have "a familiar spirit," that such practices should be allowed
to go on for a whole winter, in the house of a Puritan minister,
seems unaccountable. But the fact itself is undoubted, and the
consequences are written in mingled tears and blood upon the
saddest pages of the history of New England.</p>
<p>Among the members of this "circle" were Mary
Walcott, aged seventeen, the daughter of Captain Walcott; Elizabeth
Hubbard and Mercy Lewis, also seventeen; Elizabeth Booth and
Susannah Sheldon, aged eighteen; and Mary</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id=
"Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
Warren, Sarah Churchhill and Leah Herrick, aged
twenty; these latter being the oldest of the party. They were all
the daughters of respectable and even leading men, with the
exception of Mercy Lewis, Mary Warren, Leah Herrick and Sarah
Churchhill, who were living out as domestics, but who seem to have
visited as friends and equals the other girls in the village. In
fact, it was not considered at that time degrading in country
neighborhoods&mdash;perhaps it is not so now in many
places&mdash;for the sons and daughters of men of respectability,
and even of property, to occupy the position of "help" or servant,
eating at the same table with, and being considered members of the
family. In the case before us, Mercy Lewis, Mary Warren and Sarah
Churchhill seem to have been among the most active and influential
members of the party. Though Abigail Williams, the minister's
niece, and Ann Putnam, only eleven and twelve years of age
respectively, proved themselves capable of an immense deal of
mischief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
20]</a></span><br />
<br />
<p>What the proceedings of these young women
actually were, neither tradition nor any records that I have met
with, informs us; but the result was even worse than could have
been expected. By the close of the winter they had managed to get
their nervous systems, their imaginations, and their minds and
hearts, into a most dreadful condition. If they had regularly sold
themselves to be the servants of the Evil One, as was then
universally believed to be possible&mdash;and which may really be
possible, for anything I know to the contrary&mdash;their condition
could hardly have been worse than it was. They were liable to
sudden faintings of an unnatural character, to spasmodic movements
and jerkings of the head and limbs, to trances, to the seeing of
witches and devils, to deafness, to dumbness, to alarming outcries,
to impudent and lying speeches and statements, and to almost
everything else that was false, irregular and unnatural.</p>
<p>Some of these things were doubtless
involuntary but the voluntary and involuntary seemed to be so
mingled in their behavior, that it was difficult sometimes to
determine which was one and which the other. The moral sense seemed
to have become confused, if not utterly lost for the
time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
21]</a></span></p>
<p>They were full of tricks. They stuck
concealed pins into their bodies, and accused others of doing
it&mdash;their contortions and trances were to a great extent mere
shams&mdash;they lied without scruple&mdash;they bore false
witness, and what in many, if not most, cases they knew was false
witness, against not only those to whom they bore ill will but
against the most virtuous and kindly women of the neighborhood; and
if the religious delusion had taken another shape, and we see no
reason why it should not have done so, and put the whole of them on
trial as seekers after "familiar spirits" and condemned the older
girls to death, there would at least have been some show of justice
in the proceedings; while, as it is, there is not a single ray of
light to illuminate the judicial gloom.</p>
<p>When at last Mr. Parris and Thomas Putnam
became aware of the condition of their children, they called in the
village physician, Dr. Griggs. The latter, finding he could do
nothing with his medicines, gave it as his opinion that they were
"under an evil hand"&mdash;the polite medical phrase of that day,
for being bewitched.</p>
<p>That important point being settled, the next
followed of course, "Who has bewitched them?" The children being
asked said, "Tituba."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id=

<h4>Satan's Especial Grudge against Our Puritan
Fathers.</h4>
<p>"Tituba!" And who else? Why need there have
been anybody else? Why could not the whole thing have stopped just
there? No doubt Tituba was guilty, if any one was. But Tituba
escaped, by shrewdly also becoming an accuser.</p>
<p>"Who else?" This set the children's
imagination roving. Their first charges were not so unreasonable.
Why, the vagrant Sarah Good, a social outcast, wandering about
without any settled habitation; and Sarah Osburn, a bed-ridden
woman, half distracted by family troubles who had seen better days.
There the truth was out. Tituba, Sarah Good and Sarah Osburn were
the agents of the devil in this foul attempt against the peace of
the godly inhabitants of Salem village.</p>
<p>For it was a common belief even amongst the
wisest and best of our Puritan fathers, that the devil had a
special spite against the New England colonies. They looked at it
in this way. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id=
"Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> conquered in the fight against the
Lord in the old world. He was the supreme and undoubted lord of the
"heathen salvages" in the new. Now that the Puritan forces had
commenced an onslaught upon him in the western hemisphere, to which
he had an immemorial right as it were, could it be wondered at that
he was incensed beyond all calculation? Was he, after having
Europe, Asia and Africa, to be driven out of North America by a
small body of steeple-hatted, psalm-singing, and conceited
Puritans? No wonder his satanic ire was aroused; and that he was up
to all manner of devices to harass, disorganize and afflict the
camp of his enemies.</p>
<p>I am afraid this seems a little ridiculous to
readers nowadays; but to the men and women of two hundred years ago
it was grim and sober earnest, honestly and earnestly believed
in.</p>
<p>Who, in the face of such wonderful changes in
our religious views, can venture to predict what will be the belief
of our descendants two hundred years hence?</p>

<h4>Leah Herrick's Position and
Feelings.</h4>
<p>I have classed Leah Herrick among the
domestics; but her position was rather above that. She had lived
with the Widow Sands, Jethro's aunt, since she had been twelve
years old, assisting in the housework, and receiving her board and
clothing in return. Now, at the age of twenty, she was worth more
than that recompense; but she still remained on the old terms, as
if she were a daughter instead of a servant.</p>
<p>She remained, asking nothing more, because
she had made up her mind to be Jethro's wife. She had a passion for
Jethro, and she knew that Jethro reciprocated it. But his aunt, who
was ambitious, wished him to look higher; and therefore did not
encourage such an alliance. Leah was however too valuable and too
cheap an assistant to be dispensed with, and thus removed from such
a dangerous proximity, besides the widow really had no objection to
her, save on account of her poverty.</p>
<p>Leah said nothing when she saw that Jethro's
attentions were directed in another direction; but<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> without
saying anything directly to Dulcibel, she contrived to impress her
with the fact that she had trespassed upon her rightful domain. For
Leah was a cat; and amidst her soft purrings, she would
occasionally put out her velvety paw, and give a wicked little
scratch that made the blood come, and so softly and innocently too,
that the sufferer could hardly take offence at it.</p>
<p>Between these sharp intimations of Leah, and
the unpleasant revelations of the innate hardness of the young
man's character, which resulted from the closer intimacy of a
betrothal, Dulcibel's affection had been gradually cooling for
several months. But although the longed-for estrangement between
the two had at length taken place, Leah did not feel quite safe
yet; for the Widow Sands was very much put out about it, and
censured her nephew for his want of wisdom in not holding Dulcibel
to her engagement. "She has a good house and farm already, and she
will be certain to receive much more on the death of her bachelor
uncle in England," said the aunt sharply. "You must strive to undo
that foolish hour's work. It was only a tiff on her part, and you
should have cried your eyes out if necessary."</p>
<p>And so Leah, thinking in her own heart
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg
26]</a></span> Jethro was a prize for any girl, was in constant
dread of a renewal of the engagement, and ready to go to any length
to prevent it.</p>
<p>Although a member of the "circle" that met at
the minister's house, Leah was not so regular an attendant as the
others; for there were no men there and she never liked to miss the
opportunity of a private conversation with Jethro, opportunities
which were somewhat limited, owing to the continual watchfulness of
her mistress. Still she went frequently enough to be fully imbued
with the spirit of their doings, while not becoming such a victim
as most of them were to disordered nerves, and an impaired and
confused mental and moral constitution.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id=

<h4>A Disorderly Scene in Church.</h4>
<p>If anything were needed to add to the
excitement which the condition of the "afflicted children," as they
were generally termed, naturally produced in Salem village and the
adjoining neighborhood, it was a scene in the village church one
Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The church was a low, small structure, with
rough, unplastered roof and walls, and wooden benches instead of
pews. The sexes were divided, the men sitting on one side and the
women on the other, but each person in his or her regular and
appointed seat.</p>
<p>It was the custom at that time to select a
seating committee of judicious and careful men, whose very
important duty it was to seat the congregation. In doing this they
proceeded on certain well-defined principles.</p>
<p>The front seats were to be filled with the
older members of the congregation, a due reverence for age, as well
as for the fact that these were more apt to be weak of sight and
infirm of hearing, necessitated this. Then came the elders
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg
28]</a></span> deacons of the church; then the wealthier citizens
of the parish; then the younger people and the children.</p>
<p>The Puritan fathers had their faults; but
they never would have tolerated the fashionable custom of these
days, whereby the wealthy, without regard to their age, occupy the
front pews; and the poorer members, no matter how aged, or infirm
of sight or hearing are often forced back where they can neither
see the minister nor hear the sermon. And one can imagine in what
forcible terms they would have denounced some city meeting-houses
of the present era where the church is regarded somewhat in the
light of an opera house, and the doors of the pews kept locked and
closed until those who have purchased the right to reserved seats
shall have had the first chance to enter.</p>
<p>The Reverend Master Lawson, a visiting elder,
was the officiating minister on the Sunday to which we have
referred. The psalm had been sung after the opening prayer and the
minister was about to come forward to give his sermon, when, before
he could rise from his seat, Abigail Williams, the niece of the
Reverend Master Parris, only twelve years old, and one of the
"circle" cried out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id=
"Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> loudly:&mdash;"Now stand up and name
your text!"</p>
<p>When he had read the text, she exclaimed
insolently, "It's a long text." And then when he was referring to
his doctrine, she said:&mdash;"I know no doctrine you mentioned. If
you named any, I have forgotten it."</p>
<p>And then when he had concluded, she cried
out, "Look! there sits Goody Osburn upon the beam, suckling her
yellow-bird betwixt her fingers."</p>
<p>Then Ann Putnam, that other child of twelve,
joined in; "There flies the yellow-bird to the minister's hat,
hanging on the pin in the pulpit."</p>
<p>Of course such disorderly proceedings
produced a great excitement in the congregation; but the two
children do not appear to have been rebuked by either of the
ministers, or by any of the officers of the church; it seeming to
have been the general conclusion that they were not responsible for
what they said, but were constrained by an irresistible and
diabolical influence. In truth, the children were regarded with awe
and pity instead of reproof and blame, and therefore naturally felt
encouraged to further efforts in the same direction.</p>
<p>I have said that this was the general
feeling, but that feeling was not universal. Several of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg
30]</a></span> members, notably young Joseph Putnam, Francis Nurse
and Peter Cloyse were very much displeased at the toleration shown
to such disorderly doings, and began to absent themselves from
public worship, with the result of incurring the anger of the
children, who were rapidly assuming the role of destroying angels
to the people of Salem village and its vicinity.</p>
<p>As fasting and prayer were the usual
resources of our Puritan fathers in difficulties, these were
naturally resorted to at once upon this occasion. The families to
which the "afflicted children" belonged assembled the
neighbors&mdash;who had also fasted&mdash;and, under the guidance
of the Reverend Master Parris, besought the Lord to deliver them
from the power of the Evil One. These were exciting occasions, for,
whenever there was a pause in the proceedings, such of the
"afflicted" as were present would break out into demoniac howlings,
followed by contortions and rigid trances, which, in the words of
our manuscript, were "enough to make the devil himself
weep."</p>
<p>These village prayers, however, seeming to be
insufficient, Master Parris called a meeting of the neighboring
ministers; but the prayers of these also had no effect. The
"children" even surpassed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> themselves on this occasion. The
ministers could not doubt the evidence of their own reverend eyes
and ears, and united in the declaration of their belief that Satan
had been let loose in this little Massachusetts village, to
confound and annoy the godly, to a greater extent than they had
ever before known or heard of. And now that the ministers had
spoken, it was almost irreligious and atheistical for others to
express any doubt. For if the ministers could not speak with
authority in a case of this kind, which seemed to be within their
peculiar field and province, what was their judgment worth upon any
matter?</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id=

<h4>A Conversation with Dulcibel.</h4>
<p>As Dulcibel sat in the little room which she
had furnished in a pretty but simple way for a parlor, some days
after the meeting of the ministers, her thoughts naturally dwelt
upon all these exciting events which were occurring around her. It
was an April day, and the snow had melted earlier than usual, and
it seemed as if the spring might be an exceptionally forward one.
The sun was pleasantly warm, and the wind blowing soft and gently
from the south; and a canary bird in the rustic cage that hung on
the wall was singing at intervals a hymn of rejoicing at the coming
of the spring. The bird was one that had been given her by a
distinguished sea-captain of Boston town, who had brought it home
from the West Indies. Dulcibel had tamed and petted it, until she
could let it out from the cage and allow it to fly around the room;
then, at the words, "Come Cherry," as she opened the little door of
the cage, the bird would fly in again, knowing that he would be
rewarded for his good conduct with a little piece of sweet
cake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
33]</a></span></p>
<p>Cherry would perch on her finger and sing his
prettiest strains on some occasions; and at others eat out of her
hand. But his prettiest feat was to kiss his mistress by putting
his little beak to her lips, when she would say in a caressing
tone, "Kiss me, pretty Cherry."</p>
<p>After playing with the canary for a little
while, Dulcibel sighed and put him back in his cage, hearing a
knock at the front door of the cottage. And she had just turned
from the cage to take a seat, when the door opened and two persons
entered.</p>
<p>"I am glad to see you, friends," she said
calmly, inviting them to be seated.</p>
<p>It was Joseph Putnam, accompanied by his
friend and visitor, Ellis Raymond, the young man of whom Dulcibel
had spoken to Jethro Sands.</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam was one of that somewhat
distinguished family from whom came the Putnams of Revolutionary
fame; Major-General Israel Putnam, the wolf-slayer, being one of
his younger children. He, the father I mean, was a man of fine,
athletic frame, not only of body but of mind. He was one of the
very few in Salem village who despised the whole witch-<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>delusion
from the beginning. He did not disbelieve in the existence of
witches&mdash;or that the devil was tormenting the "afflicted
children"&mdash;but that faith should be put in their wild stories
was quite another matter.</p>
<p>Of his companion, Master Ellis Raymond, I
find no other certain account anywhere than in my Quaker friend's
manuscript. From the little that is there given of personal
description I have only the three phrases "a comelie young man," "a
very quick-witted person," "a very determined and courageous man,"
out of which to build a physical and spiritual description. And so
I think it rather safer to leave the portraiture to the imagination
of my readers.</p>
<p>"Do you expect to remain long in Salem?"
asked Dulcibel.</p>
<p>"I do not know yet," was the reply. "I came
that I might see what prospects the new world holds out to young
men."</p>
<p>"I want Master Raymond to purchase the
Orchard Farm, and settle down among us," said Joseph Putnam. "It
can be bought I think."</p>
<p>"I have heard people say the price is a very
high one," said Dulcibel.</p>
<p>"It is high but the land is worth the money.
In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg
35]</a></span> twenty years it will seem very low. My father saw
the time when a good cow was worth as much as a fifty-acre farm,
but land is continually rising in value."</p>
<p>"I shall look farther south before deciding,"
said Raymond. "I am told the land is better there; besides there
are too many witches here," and he smiled.</p>
<p>"We have been up to see my brother Thomas,"
continued Joseph Putnam. "He always has had the reputation of being
a sober-headed man, but he is all off his balance now."</p>
<p>"What does Mistress Putnam say?" asked
Dulcibel.</p>
<p>"Oh, she is at the bottom of all his
craziness, she and that elfish daughter. Sister Ann is a very
intelligent woman in some respects, but she is wild upon this
question."</p>
<p>"I am told by the neighbors that the child is
greatly afflicted."</p>
<p>"She came in the room while we were there,"
responded Master Raymond. "I knew not what to make of it. She flung
herself down on the floor, she crept under the table, she shrieked,
she said Goody Osburn was sticking pins in her, and wound up by
going into convulsions."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id=
"Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>"What can it all mean?&mdash;it is terrible,"
said Dulcibel.</p>
<p>"Well, the Doctor says she is suffering under
an 'evil hand,' and the ministers have given their solemn opinion
that she is bewitched; and brother Thomas and Sister Ann, and about
all the rest of the family agree with them."</p>
<p>"I am afraid it will go hard with those two
old women," interposed Ellis Raymond.</p>
<p>"They will hang them as sure as they are
tried," answered Joseph Putnam. "Not that it makes much difference,
for neither of them is much to speak of; but they have a right to a
fair trial nevertheless, and they cannot get such a thing just now
in Salem village.</p>
<p>"I can hardly believe there are such things
as witches," said Dulcibel, "and if there are, I do not believe the
good Lord would allow them to torment innocent
children."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know that it will do to say
there are no witches," replied Joseph Putnam gravely. "It seems to
me we must give up the Bible if we say that. For the Old Testament
expressly commands that we must not suffer a witch to live; and it
would be absurd to give such a command if there were no such
persons as witches."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id=
"Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>"I suppose it must be so," admitted Dulcibel,
with a deep sigh.</p>
<p>"And then again in the New Testament we have
continual references to persons possessed with devils, and others
who had familiar spirits, and if such persons existed then, why not
now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, of course, it is so," again admitted
Dulcibel with even a deeper sigh than before.</p>
<p>But even in that day, outside of the Puritan
and other religious bodies, there were unbelievers; and Ellis
Raymond had allowed himself to smile once or twice, unperceived by
the others, during their conversation. Thus we read in the life of
that eminent jurist, the Honorable Francis North, who presided at a
trial for witchcraft about ten years before the period of which we
are writing, that he looked upon the whole thing as a vulgar
delusion, though he said it was necessary to be very careful to
conceal such opinions from the juries of the time, or else they
would set down the judges at once as irreligious persons, and bring
in the prisoners guilty.</p>
<p>"I am not so certain of it," said Ellis
Raymond.</p>
<p>"How! What do you mean, Master Raymond?"
exclaimed Joseph Putnam; like all his family, he was orthodox to
the bone in his opinions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38"
id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>"My idea is that in the old times they
supposed all distracted and insane people&mdash;especially the
violent ones, the maniacs&mdash;to be possessed with
devils."</p>
<p>"Do you think so?" queried Dulcibel in a glad
voice, a light seeming to break in upon her.</p>
<p>"Well, I take it for granted that there were
plenty of insane people in the old times as there are now; and yet
I see no mention of them as such, in either the Old or the New
Testament."</p>
<p>"I never thought of that before; it seems to
me a very reasonable explanation, does it not strike you so, Master
Putnam?"</p>
<p>"So reasonable, that it reasons away all our
faith in the absolute truthfulness of every word of the holy
scriptures," replied Joseph Putnam sternly. "Do you suppose the
Evangelists, when they spoke of persons having 'familiar spirits,'
and being 'possessed of devils,' did not know what they were
talking about? I would rather believe that every insane person now
is possessed with a devil, and that such is the true explanation of
his or her insanity, than to fly in the face of the holy scriptures
as you do, Master Raymond."</p>
<p>Dulcibel's countenance fell. "Yes," she
re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg
39]</a></span>sponded in reverential tones, "the holy Evangelists
must know best. If they said so, it must be so."</p>
<p>"You little orthodox darling!" thought young
Master Raymond, gazing upon her beautiful sad face. But of course
he did not express himself to such an effect, except by his gaze;
and Dulcibel happening to look up and catch the admiring expression
of two clear brown eyes, turned her own instantly down again, while
a faint blush mantled her cheeks.</p>
<p>The young Englishman knew that in arousing
such heterodox opinions he was getting on dangerous ground. For
expressing not a greater degree of heresy than he had uttered,
other men and even women had been turned neck and heels out of the
Puritan settlements. And as he had no desire to leave Salem just at
present, he began to "hedge" a little, as betting men sometimes
say.</p>
<p>"Insane people, maniacs especially, do
sometimes act as if they were possessed of the devil," he said
frankly. "And no doubt their insanity is often the result of the
sinful indulgence of their wicked propensities and
passions."</p>
<p>"Yes, that seems to be very reasonable," said
Dulcibel. "Every sinful act seems to me a yielding to the evil one,
and such yielding becom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id=
"Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>ing common, he may at least be able to
enter into the soul, and take absolute possession of it. Oh, it is
very fearful!" and she shuddered.</p>
<p>"But I find one opinion almost universal in
Salem," continued Raymond, "and that is one which I think has no
ground to sustain it in the scriptures, and is very mischievous. It
is that the devil cannot act directly upon human beings to afflict
and torment them; but that he is forced to have recourse to the
agency of other human beings, who have become his worshipers and
agents. Thus in the cases of these children and young girls,
instead of admitting that the devil and his imps are directly
afflicting them, they begin to look around for witches and wizards
as the sources of the trouble."</p>
<p>"Yes," responded Joseph Putnam earnestly,
"that false and unscriptural doctrine is the source of all the
trouble. That little Ann Putnam, Abigail Williams and the others
are bewitched, may perhaps be true&mdash;a number of godly
ministers say so, and they ought to know. But, if they are
bewitched, it is the devil and his imps that have done it. If they
are 'possessed with devils'&mdash;and does not that scripture mean
that the devils directly take possession of them&mdash;what is
their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg
41]</a></span> testimony worth against others? It is nearly the
testimony of Satan and his imps, speaking through them. While they
are in that state, their evidence should not be allowed credence by
any magistrate, any more than the devil's should."</p>
<p>It seems very curious to those of the present
day who have investigated this matter of witch persecutions, that
such a sound and orthodox view as this of Joseph Putnam's should
have had such little weight with the judges and ministers and other
leading men of the seventeenth century. While a few urged it, even
as Joseph Putnam did, at the risk of his own life, the great
majority not only of the common people but of the leading classes,
regarded it as unsound and irreligious. But the whole history of
the world proves that the <i>vox populi</i> is very seldom the
<i>vox Dei</i>. The light shines down from the rising sun in the
heavens, and the mountain tops first receive the rays. The last new
truth is always first perceived by the small minority of superior
minds and souls. How indeed could it be otherwise, so long as truth
like light always shines down from above?</p>
<p>"Have you communicated this view to your
brother and sister?" asked Dulcibel.</p>
<p>"I have talked with them for a whole
evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg
42]</a></span> but I do think Sister Ann is possessed too," replied
Joseph Putnam. "She fairly raves sometimes. You know how bitterly
she feels about that old church quarrel, when a small minority of
the Parish succeeded in preventing the permanent settlement of her
sister's husband as minister. She seems to have the idea that all
that party are emissaries of Satan. I do not wonder her little girl
should be so nervous and excitable, being the child of such a
nervous, high-strung woman. But I am going to see them again this
afternoon; will you go too, Master Raymond?'</p>
<p>"I think not," replied the latter with a
smile, "I should do harm, I fear, instead of good. I will stay here
and talk with Mistress Dulcibel a little while longer."</p>
<p>Master Putnam departed, and then the
conversation became of a lighter character. The young Englishman
told Dulcibel of his home in the old world, and of his travels in
France and Switzerland. And they talked of all those little things
which young people will&mdash;little things, but which afford
constant peeps into each other's mind and heart. Dulcibel thought
she had never met such a cultivated young man, although she had
read of such; and he felt very certain that<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> he
never met with such a lovely young woman. Not that she was over
intelligent&mdash;one of those precociously "smart" young women
that, thanks to the female colleges and the "higher culture" are
being "developed" in such alarming numbers nowadays. If she had
been such a being, I fancy Master Raymond would have found her less
attractive. Ah, well, after a time perhaps, we of the present day
shall have another craze&mdash;that of barbarism&mdash;in which the
"coming woman" shall pride herself mainly upon possessing a strong,
healthy and vigorous physical organization, developed within the
feminine lines of beauty, and only a reasonable degree of
intelligence and "culture." And then I hope we shall see the last
of walking female encyclopedias, with thin waists, and sickly and
enfeebled bodies; fit to be the mothers only of a rapidly dwindling
race, even if they have the wish and power to become mothers at
all.</p>
<p>I am not much of a believer in love at first
sight, but certainly persons may become very much interested in
each other after a few hours' conversation; and so it was in the
case before us. When Ellis Raymond took up his hat, and then
lingered minute after minute, as if he could not bring himself to
the point of departure, he simply<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> manifested anew to the
maiden what his tones and looks had been telling her for an hour,
that he admired her very greatly.</p>
<p>"Come soon again," Dulcibel said softly, as
the young man managed to open the door at last, and make his final
adieu. "And indeed I shall if you will permit me," was his earnest
response.</p>
<p>But some fair reader may ask, "What were
these two doing during all the winter, that they had not seen each
other?"</p>
<p>I answer that Dulcibel had withdrawn from the
village gatherings since the breaking of the engagement with
Jethro. At the best, it was an acknowledgment that she had been too
hasty in a matter that she should not have allowed herself to fail
in; and she felt humbled under the thought. Besides, it seemed to
her refined and sensitive nature only decorous that she should
withdraw for a time into the seclusion of her own home under such
circumstances.</p>
<p>As for the village gossips, they entirely
misinterpreted her conduct. Inasmuch as Jethro went around as
usual, and put a bold face upon the matter, they came to the
conclusion that he had thrown her off, and that she was moping at
home, because she felt the blow so keenly.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
45]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus it was that while the young Englishman
had attended many social gatherings during the winter he had never
met the one person whom he was especially desirous of again
meeting.</p>
<p>One little passage of the conversation
between the two it may be well however to refer to expressly for
its bearing upon a very serious matter. Raymond had mentioned that
he had not seen her recently flying around on that little jet black
horse, and had asked whether she still owned it.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," replied Dulcibel; "I doubt that I
should be able to sell Little Witch if I wished to do
so."</p>
<p>"Ah, how is that? She seems to be a very fine
riding beast."</p>
<p>"She is, very! But you have not heard that I
am the only one that has ever ridden her or that can ride
her."</p>
<p>"Indeed! that is curious."</p>
<p>I have owned her from a little colt. She was
never broken to harness; and no one, as I said, has ever ridden her
but me. So that now if any other person, man or woman, attempts to
do so, she will not allow it. She rears, she plunges, and finally
as a last resort, if necessary, lies down on the ground and refuses
to stir.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
46]</a></span> "Why, that is very flattering to you, Dulcibel,"
said Raymond smiling. "I never knew an animal of better
taste."</p>
<p>"That may be," replied the maiden blushing;
"but you see how it is that I shall never be able to sell Little
Witch if I desire to do so. She is not worth her keep to any one
but me."</p>
<p>"Little Witch! Why did you ever give her a
name like that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I was a mere child&mdash;and my father,
who had been a sea-captain, and all over the world, did not believe
in witches. He named her "Little Witch" because she was so black,
and so bent on her own way. But I must change her name now that
people are talking so about witches. In truth my mother never liked
it."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id=

<h4>An Examination of Reputed
Witches.</h4>
<p>Warrants had been duly issued against Sarah
Good, Sarah Osburn, and the Indian woman Tituba, and they were now
to be tried for the very serious offence of bewitching the
"afflicted children."</p>
<p>One way that the witches of that day were
supposed to work, was to make images out of rags, like dolls, which
they named for the persons they meant to torment. Then, by sticking
pins and needles into the dolls, tightening cords around their
throats, and similar doings, the witches caused the same amount of
pain as if they had done it to the living objects of their
enmity.</p>
<p>In these cases, the officers who executed the
warrants of arrest, stated "that they had made diligent search for
images and such like, but could find none."</p>
<p>On the day appointed for the examination of
these poor women, the two leading magistrates of the neighborhood,
John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin, rode up the principal street of
the village attended by the marshal and constables, in
quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg
48]</a></span> an imposing array. The crowd was so great that they
had to hold the session in the meeting-house The magistrates
belonged to the highest legislative and judicial body in the
colony. Hathorne, as the name was then spelt, was the ancestor of
the gifted author, Nathaniel Hawthorne&mdash;the alteration in the
spelling of the name probably being made to make it conform more
nearly to the pronunciation. Hathorne was a man of force and
ability&mdash;though evidently also as narrow-minded and unfair as
only a bigot can be. All through the examination that ensued he
took a leading part, and with him, to be accused was to be set down
at once as guilty. Never, among either Christian or heathen people,
was there a greater travesty of justice than these examinations and
trials for witchcraft, conducted by the very foremost men of the
Massachusetts colony.</p>
<p>The accounts of the examination of these
three women in the manuscript book I have alluded to, are
substantially the same as in the official records, which are among
those that have been preserved. I will give some quotations to show
how the examinations were conducted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sarah Good, what evil spirit are you
familiar with?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id=
"Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>She answered sharply, "None!"</p>
<p>"Have you made no contracts with the
Devil?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Why then do you hurt these
children?"</p>
<p>"I do not hurt them. I would scorn to do
it."</p>
<p>"Here the children who were facing her, began
to be dreadfully tormented; and then when their torments were over
for the time, again accused her, and also Sarah Osburn.</p>
<p>"Sarah Good, why do you not tell us the
truth? Why do you thus torment them?"</p>
<p>"I do not torment them."</p>
<p>"Who then does torment them?"</p>
<p>"It may be that Sarah Osburn does, for I do
not."</p>
<p>"Her answers," says the official report,
"were very quick, sharp and malignant."</p>
<p>It must be remembered in reading these
reports, that the accused were not allowed any counsel, either at
the preliminary examinations, or on the trials; that the apparent
sufferings of the children were very great, producing almost a
frenzied state of feeling in the crowd who looked on; and that they
themselves were often as much puzzled as their accusers, to account
for what was taking place before their eyes.</p>
<p>In the examination of Sarah Osburn, we
have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg
50]</a></span> similar questions and similar answers. In addition,
however, three witnesses alleged that she had said that very
morning, that she was "more like to be bewitched herself." Mr.
Hathorne asked why she said that. She answered that either she saw
at one time, or dreamed that she saw, a thing like an Indian, all
black, which did pinch her in the neck, and pulled her by the back
part of the head to the door of the house. And there was also a
lying spirit.</p>
<p>"What lying spirit was this?"</p>
<p>"It was a voice that I thought I
heard."</p>
<p>"What did it say to you?"</p>
<p>"That I should go no more to meeting; but I
said I would, and did go the next Sabbath day."</p>
<p>"Were you ever tempted further?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Why did you yield then to the Devil, not to
go to meeting for the last three years?"</p>
<p>"Alas! I have been sick all that time, and
not able to go."</p>
<p>Then Tituba was brought in. Tituba was in the
"circle" or an attendant and inspirer of the "circle" from the
first; and had marvelous things to tell. How it was that the
"children" turned against her and accused her, I do not know; but
probably she had practised so much upon them<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> in
various ways, that she really was guilty of trying to do the things
she was charged with.</p>
<p>"Tituba, why do you hurt these
children?"</p>
<p>"Tituba does not hurt 'em."</p>
<p>"Who does hurt them then?"</p>
<p>"The debbil, for all I knows.'</p>
<p>"Did you ever see the Devil?" Tituba gave a
low laugh. "Of course I've seen the debbil. The debbil came an'
said, 'Serb me, Tituba.' But I would not hurt the
child'en."</p>
<p>"Who else have you seen?"</p>
<p>"Four women. Goody Osburn and Sarah Good, and
two other women. Dey all hurt de child'en."</p>
<p>"How does the Devil appear to
you?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes he is like a dog, and sometimes
like a hog. The black dog always goes with a yellow
bird."</p>
<p>"Has the Devil any other shapes?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he sometimes comes as a red cat, and
then a black cat."</p>
<p>"And they all tell you to hurt the
children?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I said I would not."</p>
<p>"Did you not pinch Elizabeth Hubbard this
morning?"</p>
<p>"The black man brought me to her, and made me
pinch her."</p>
<p>"Why did you go to Thomas Putnam's last night
and hurt his daughter Ann?"</p>
<p>"He made me go."<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg
52]</a></span></p>
<p>"How did you go?"</p>
<p>"We rode on sticks; we soon got
there."</p>
<p>"Has Sarah Good any familiar?"</p>
<p>"Yes, a yeller bird. It sucks her between her
fingers. And Sarah Osburn has a thing with a head like a woman, and
it has two wings."</p>
<p>("Abigail Williams, who lives with her uncle,
the Rev. Master Parris, here testified that she did see the same
creature, and it turned into the shape of Goody
Osburn.")</p>
<p>"Tituba further said that she had also seen a
hairy animal with Goody Osburn, that had only two legs, and walked
like a man. And that she saw Sarah Good, last Saturday, set a wolf
upon Elizabeth Hubbard."</p>
<p>("The friends of Elizabeth Hubbard here said
that she did complain of being torn by a wolf on that
day.")</p>
<p>"Tituba being asked further to describe her
ride to Thomas Putnam's, for the purpose of tormenting his daughter
Ann, said that she rode upon a stick or pole, and Sarah Good and
Sarah Osburn behind her, all taking hold of one another. Did not
know how it was done, for she saw no trees nor path, but was
presently there."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id=
"Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> These examinations were continued for
several days, each of the accused being brought at various times
before the magistrates, who seem to have taken great interest in
the absurd stories with which the "afflicted children" and Tituba
regaled them. Finally, all three of the accused were committed to
Boston jail, there to await their trial for practising witchcraft;
being heavily ironed, as, being witches, it was supposed to be very
difficult to keep them from escaping; and as their ability to
torment people with their spectres, was considered lessened in
proportion to the weight and tightness of the chains with which
they were fettered. It is not to be wondered at, that under these
inflictions, at the end of two months, the invalid, Sarah Osburn,
died. Tituba, however, lay in jail until, finally, at the
expiration of a year and a month, she was sold in payment of her
jail fees. One account saying that her owner, the Rev. Master
Parris, refused to pay her jail fees, unless she would still adhere
to what she had testified on her examination, instead of alleging
that he whipped and otherwise abused her, to make her confess that
she was a witch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id=
"Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<h4>One Hundred and Fifty More Alleged
Witches.</h4>
<p>Ah this was bad enough, but it was but the
beginning of trouble. Tituba had spoken of two other women, but had
given no names. The "afflicted children" were still afflicted, and
growing worse, instead of better. The Rev. Master Noyes of Salem
town, the Rev. Master Parris of Salem village, Sergeant Thomas
Putnam, and his wife,&mdash;which last also was becoming bewitched,
and had many old enmities&mdash;and many other influential people
and church members, were growing more excited, and vindictive
against the troubles of their peace, with every passing
day.</p>
<p>"Who are they that still torment you in this
horrible manner?" was the question asked of the children and young
women, and they had their answers ready.</p>
<p>There had been an old quarrel between the
Endicotts and the Nurses, a family which owned the Bishop Farm,
about the eastern boundary of said farm. There had been the quarrel
about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg
55]</a></span> who should be minister, in which the Nurses had
sided with the determined opponents of Mistress Ann Putnam's
reverend brother-in-law. The Nurses and other families were staunch
opposers of Master Parris's claim to ownership of the Parsonage and
its grounds. And it was not to be wondered at, that the accusations
should be made against opponents rather than against
friends.</p>
<p>Besides, there were those who had very little
faith in the children themselves, and had taken a kind of stand
against them; and these too, were in a dangerous
position.</p>
<p>"Who torments you now?" The answer was ready:
Martha Corey, and Rebecca Nurse, and Bridget Bishop, and so on; the
charges being made now against the members, often the heads, of the
most reputable families in Salem town and village and the
surrounding neighborhoods. Before the coming of the winter snows
probably one hundred and fifty persons were in prison at Salem and
Ipswich and Boston and Cambridge. Two-thirds of these were women;
many of them were aged and venerable men and women of the highest
reputation for behavior and piety. Yet, they were bound with
chains, and exposed to all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56"
id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> the hardships that attended
incarceration in small and badly constructed prisons.</p>
<p>A special court composed of the leading
judges in the province being appointed by the Governor for the
trial of these accused persons, a mass of what would be now styled
"utter nonsense" was brought against them. No wonder that the
official record of this co-called court of justice is now nowhere
to be found. The partial accounts that have come down to us are
sufficient to brand its proceeding with everlasting infamy. Let us
recur to the charges against some of these persons:</p>
<p>The Rev. Cotton Mather, speaking of the trial
of Bridget Bishop, says: "There was one strange thing with which
the Court was <i>newly entertained</i>. As this woman was passing
by the meeting-house, she gave a look towards the house; and
immediately a demon, invisibly entering the house, tore down a part
of it; so that, though there was no person to be seen there, yet
the people, at the noise, running in, found a board, which was
strongly fastened with several nails, transported into another
quarter of the house."</p>
<p>A court of very ignorant men would be
"entertained" now with such a story, in a very different sense from
that in which the Rev. Cotton Mather<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> used the word. The Court
of 1692, doubtless swallowed the story whole, for it was no more
absurd than the bulk of the evidence upon which they condemned the
reputed witches.</p>
<p>One of the charges against the Rev. Master
Burroughs, who had himself been a minister for a short time in the
village, was, that though a small, slender man, he was a giant in
strength. Several persons witnessed that "he had held out a gun of
seven foot barrel with one hand; and had carried a barrel full of
cider from a canoe to the shore." Burroughs said that an Indian
present at the time did the same, but the answer was ready. "That
was the black man, or the Devil, who looks like an
Indian."</p>
<p>Another charge against Master Burroughs was,
that he went on a certain occasion between two places in a shorter
time than was possible, if the Devil had not assisted him. Both
Increase Mather, the father, and his son Cotton, two of the most
prominent and influential of the Boston ministers, said that the
testimony as to Mr. Burroughs' giant strength was alone sufficient
rightfully to convict him. It is not improbable that the real
animus of the feeling against Master Burroughs was the belief that
he was not sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id=
"Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> in the faith; for Master Cotton
Mather, after his execution, declared to the people that he was "no
ordained minister," and called their attention to the fact that
Satan often appeared as an angel of light.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id=

<h4>Bridget Bishop Condemned to Die.</h4>
<p>Salem, the habitation of peace, had become,
by this time a pandemonium. The "afflicted children" were making
accusations in every direction, and Mistress Ann Putnam, and many
others, were imitating their example.</p>
<p>To doubt was to be accused; but very few
managed to keep their heads sufficiently in the whirlwind of
excitement, even to be able to doubt. With the exception of Joseph
Putnam, and his visitor, Ellis Raymond, there were very few, if
any, open and outspoken doubters, and indignant censurers of the
whole affair. Dulcibel Burton also, though in a gentler and less
emphatic way, sided naturally with them, but, although she was much
less violent in her condemnation, she provoked even more anger from
the orthodox believers in the delusion.</p>
<p>For Joseph Putnam, as belonging to one of the
most influential and wealthy families in Salem, seemed to have some
right to have an opinion. And Master Raymond was visiting at his
house, and naturally would be influenced by him.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg
60]</a></span></p>
<p>Besides, he was only a stranger at the best;
and therefore, not entirely responsible to them for his views. But
Dulcibel was a woman, and it was outrageous that she, at her years,
should set up her crude opinions against the authority of the
ministers and the elders.</p>
<p>Besides, Joseph Putnam was known to be a
determined and even rather desperate young man when his passions
were aroused, as they seldom were though, save in some just cause;
and he had let it be known that it would be worth any person's life
to attempt to arrest him. It was almost the universal habit of that
day, to wear the belt and sword; and Messrs. Putnam and Raymond
went thus constantly armed. Master Putnam also kept two horses
constantly saddled in his stable, day and night, to escape with if
necessary, into the forest, through which they might make their way
to New York. For the people of that province, who did not admire
their Puritan neighbors very much, received all such fugitives
gladly, and gave them full protection.</p>
<p>As for Master Raymond, although he saw that
his position was becoming dangerous, he determined to remain,
notwithstanding the period which he had fixed for his departure had
long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg
61]</a></span> before arrived. His avowed reason given to Joseph
Putnam, was that he was resolved to see the crazy affair through.
His avowed reason, which Master Putnam perfectly understood, was to
prosecute his suit to Dulcibel, and see her safely through the
dangerous excitement also.</p>
<p>"They have condemned Bridget Bishop to
death," said Master Putnam, coming into the house one morning from
a conversation with a neighbor.</p>
<p>"I supposed they would," replied Master
Raymond. "But how nobly she bore herself against such a mass of
stupid and senseless testimony. Did you know her?"</p>
<p>"I have often stopped at her Inn. A fine,
free-spoken woman; a little bold in her manners, but nothing wrong
about her."</p>
<p>"Did you ever hear such nonsense as that
about her tearing down a part of the meeting-house simply by
looking at it? And yet there sat the best lawyers in the colony on
the bench as her judges, and swallowed it all down as if it had
been gospel."</p>
<p>"And then those other stories of her
appearing in people's bed-rooms, and vanishing away suddenly; and
of her being responsible for the illness<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> and
death of her neighbors' children; what could be more
absurd?"</p>
<p>"And of the finding of puppets, made of rags
and hogs' bristles, in the walls and crevices of her cellar!
Really, it would be utterly contemptible if it were not so
horrible."</p>
<p>"Yes, she is to be executed on Gallows Hill;
and next week! I can scarcely believe it, Master Raymond. If I
could muster a score or two of other stout fellows, I would carry
her off from the very foot of the gallows."</p>
<p>"Oh, the frenzy has only begun, my friend,"
replied Raymond. "You know whose trial comes on next?"</p>
<p>"How any one can say a word against Mistress
Nurse&mdash;that lovely and venerable woman&mdash;passeth my
comprehension," said Joseph Putnam's young wife, who had been a
listener to the conversation, while engaged in some household
duties.</p>
<p>"My sister-in-law, Ann Putnam, seems to have
a spite against that woman. I went to see her yesterday, and she
almost foams at the mouth while talking of her."</p>
<p>"The examination of Mistress Nurse before the
magistrate comes off to-day. Shall we not attend it?"<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg
63]</a></span></p>
<p>"Of course, but be careful of thy language,
Friend Raymond. Do not let thy indignation run away with thy
discretion."</p>
<p>Raymond laughed outright, as did young
Mistress Putnam. "This advice from you, Master Joseph! who art such
a very model of prudence and cold-bloodedness! If thou wilt be only
half as cautious and discreet as I am, we shall give no offence
even to the craziest of them."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id=
"Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<h4>Examination of Rebecca Nurse.</h4>
<p>When they arrived at the village, the
examination was in progress. Mistress Rebecca Nurse, the mother of
a large family; aged, venerable, and bending now a little under the
weight of years, was standing as a culprit before the magistrates,
who doubtless had often met her in the social gatherings of the
neighborhood.</p>
<p>She was guarded by two constables, she who
needed no guarding. Around, and as near her as they were allowed to
stand, stood her husband and her grown-up sons and
daughters.</p>
<p>One of the strangest features of the time, as
it strikes the reader of this day, was the peaceful submission to
the lawful authorities practised by the husbands and fathers, and
grown-up sons and brothers of the women accused. Reaching as the
list of alleged witches did in a short time, to between one hundred
and fifty and two hundred persons&mdash;nearly the whole of them
members of the most respectable families&mdash;it is wonderful that
a determined stand in their behalf was not the result. One hundred
resolute men, resolved to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65"
id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> sacrifice their lives if need be,
would have put a stop to the whole matter. And if there had been
even twenty men in Salem, like Joseph Putnam, the thing no doubt
would have been done.</p>
<p>And in the opinion of the present writer,
such a course would have been far more worthy of praise, than the
slavish submission to such outrages as were perpetrated under the
names of law, justice and religion. The sons of these men, eighty
years later, showed at Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, that
when Law and Peace become but grotesque masks, under which are
hidden the faces of legalized injustice and tyranny, then the time
has come for armed revolt and organized resistance.</p>
<p>But such was the darkness and bigotry of the
day in respect to religious belief, that the great majority of the
people were mentally paralyzed by the accepted faith, so that they
were not able in many respects to distinguish light from darkness.
When an estimable man or woman was accused of being a witch, for
the term was indifferently applied to both sexes, even their own
married partners, their own children, had a more or less strong
conviction that it might possibly be so. And this made the peculiar
horror of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id=
"Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>In at least fifty cases, the accused
confessed that they were witches, and sometimes accused others in
turn. This was owing generally to the influence of their relatives,
who implored them to confess; for to confess was invariably to be
acquitted, or to be let off with simple imprisonment.</p>
<p>But to return to poor Rebecca Nurse, haled
without warning from her prosperous, happy home at the Bishop Farm,
carried to jail, loaded with chains, and now brought up for the
tragic farce of a judicial examination. In this case also, the
account given in my friend's little book is amply confirmed by
other records. Mistress Ann Putnam, Abigail Williams (the
minister's niece), Elizabeth Hubbard and Mary Walcott, were the
accusers.</p>
<p>"Abigail Williams, have you been hurt by this
woman?" said magistrate Hathorne.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Abigail. And then Mistress Ann
Putnam fell to the floor in a fit; crying out between her violent
spasms, that it was Rebecca Nurse who was then afflicting
her.</p>
<p>"What do you say to those charges?" The
accused replied: "I can say before the eternal Father that I am
innocent of any such wicked doings, and God will clear my
innocence."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg
67]</a></span></p>
<p>Then a man named Henry Kenney rose, and said
that Mistress Nurse frequently tormented him also; and that even
since he had been there that day, he had been seized twice with an
amazed condition.</p>
<p>"The villain!" muttered Joseph Putnam to
those around him, "if I had him left to me for a time, I would have
him in an amazed condition!"</p>
<p>"You are an unbeliever, and everybody knows
it, Master Putnam," said one near him. "But we who are of the
godly, know that Satan goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom
he may devour."</p>
<p>"Quiet there!" said one of the
magistrates.</p>
<p>Edward Putnam (another of the brothers) then
gave in his evidence, saying that he had seen Mistress Ann Putnam,
and the other accusers, grievously tormented again and again, and
declaring that Rebecca Nurse was the person who did it.</p>
<p>"These are serious charges, Mistress Nurse,"
said Squire Hathorne, "are they true?"</p>
<p>"I have told you that they are false. Why, I
was confined to my sick bed at the time it is said they
occurred."</p>
<p>"But did you not send your spectre to torment
them?"</p>
<p>"How could I? And I would not if I
could."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg
68]</a></span></p>
<p>Here Mistress Putnam was taken with another
fit. Worse than the other, which greatly affected the whole people.
Coming to a little, she cried out: "Did you not bring the black man
with you? Did you not tell me to tempt God and die? Did you not eat
and drink the red blood to your own damnation?"</p>
<p>These words were shrieked out so wildly, that
all the people were greatly agitated and murmured against such
wickedness. But the prisoner releasing her hand for a moment cried
out, "Oh, Lord, help me!"</p>
<p>"Hold her hands," some cried then, for the
afflicted persons seemed to be grievously tormented by her. But her
hands being again firmly held by the guards, they seemed
comforted.</p>
<p>Then the worthy magistrate Hathorne said, "Do
you not see that when your hands are loosed these people are
afflicted?"</p>
<p>"The Lord knows," she answered, "that I have
not hurt them."</p>
<p>"You would do well if you are guilty to
confess it; and give glory to God."</p>
<p>"I have nothing to confess. I am as innocent
as an unborn child."</p>
<p>"Is it not strange that when you are
examined, these persons should be afflicted thus?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is very strange."</p>
<a name="col02" id="col02"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/col02.jpg"><img src="images/col02_th.jpg" alt="The Lord knows that I haven't hurt them" title="The Lord knows that I haven't hurt them" /></a></div>
<div class="figcenter"><span class="caption"><small>"The Lord knows
that I haven't hurt them"</small></span></div>
<p>"Do you believe these afflicted persons are
bewitched?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg
69]</a></span></p>
<p>"I surely do think they must be."</p>
<p>Weary of the proceedings and the excitement,
the aged lady allowed her head to droop on one side. Instantly the
heads of the accusers were bent the same way.</p>
<p>Abigail Williams cried out, "Set up Mistress
Nurse's neck, our necks will all be broken." The jailers held up
the prisoner's neck; and the necks of all the accused were
instantly made straight again. This was considered a marvelous
proof; and produced a wonderful effect upon the magistrates and the
people. Mistress Ann Putnam went into such great bodily agony at
this time, charging it all upon the prisoner, that the magistrates
gave her husband permission to carry her out of the house. Only
then, when no longer in the sight of the prisoner, could she regain
her peace.</p>
<p>"Mistress Nurse was then recommitted to the
jail in Salem, in order to further examination."</p>
<p>"What deviltry is coming next?" said Joseph
Putnam to his friend.</p>
<p>Many of those around glared on the speaker,
but he was well known to all of them as a daring&mdash;and when
angered even a desperate young man<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>&mdash;and they allowed
him to say with impunity, freely what no one else could even have
whispered. His son in after years, looked not into the wolf's eyes
in the dark den with a sterner gaze, than he looked into the
superstitious and vengeful wolves' eyes around him.</p>
<p>"To think that a godly old woman like
Mistress Nurse, should be tormented by this Devil's brood of
witches, led on by that she-devil sister of mine, Ann
Putnam."</p>
<p>Many around heard him, but none cared to meet
the young man's fierce eyes, as they blazed upon those that were
nearest.</p>
<p>"Do control yourself, my friend," whispered
Master Raymond. "Preserve yourself for a time when your indignation
may do some good."</p>
<p>Then the constable brought in a little girl
of about five years of age, Dorcas Good, a daughter of Sarah Good,
who had been arrested on the complaint of Edward and Jonathan
Putnam.</p>
<p>The evidence against this little girl of five
was overwhelming. Mistress Ann Putnam, Mercy Lewis, and Mary
Walcott were the accusers&mdash;charging the innocent and pretty
little creature with biting, pinching and choking them&mdash;the
little girl smiling while they were giving their<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
testimony. She was not old enough to understand what it was all
about, and that even her life was in danger from these demoniacs.
They absolutely pretended to show the marks of her little teeth in
their arms. Then, after going through the usual convulsions, they
shrieked out that she was running pins into them; and the pins were
found on examination sticking into their bodies.</p>
<p>The little girl was, as I have said, at first
inclined to laugh at all the curious proceedings, and the spasms
and contortions of the witnesses, but at last, seeing everyone so
solemn and looking so wickedly at her, she began to cry; until
Joseph Putnam went up to her and gave her some sweet cake to eat,
which he had provided for his own luncheon and then, looking into
his kind face, she began to smile again.</p>
<p>The Magistrates frowned upon Master Putnam,
as he did this, but he paid no attention to their frowns. And when
the little girl was ordered back to jail as a prisoner to await her
trial, he bent down and kissed her before she was led away by the
constable.</p>
<p>This was the end of the proceedings for that
day and the crowd began to disperse.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>"This is a pretty day's work you have made of
it, sister-in-law," said Joseph Putnam, striding up to his
brother's wife. "You say that you are tormented by many devils, and
I believe it. Now I want to give you, and all the Devil's brood
around you, fair warning that if you dare to touch with your foul
lies any one belonging to my house including the stranger within my
gates, you shall answer it with your lives, in spite of all your
judges and prisons."</p>
<p>So saying, he glared at his two brothers, who
made no reply, and walked out of the meeting-house in which this
ungodly business had been transacted.</p>
<p>"Oh, it is only Joe," said Thomas Putnam; "he
always was the spoiled child of the family."</p>
<p>His wife said nothing, but soon a hard,
bitter smile took the place of the angry flush that the young man's
words had produced. Dulcibel Burton was not one of his household,
nor within his gates.</p>

<h4>Burn Me, or Hang Me, I Will Stand in the
Truth of Christ.</h4>
<p>After the trial and conviction of Bridget
Bishop, the Special Court of seven Judges&mdash;a majority of whom
were leading citizens of Boston, the Deputy Governor of the
Province, acting as Chief-Justice&mdash;decided to take further
counsel in this wonderful and important matter of the fathers of
the church. So the Court took a recess, while it consulted the
ministers of Boston and other places, respecting its duty in the
case. The response of the ministers, while urging in general terms
the importance of caution and circumspection, recommended the
earnest and vigorous carrying on of the war against Satan and his
disciples.</p>
<p>Among the new victims, one of the most
striking cases was that of George Jacobs and his grand-daughter
Margaret. The former was a venerable-looking man, very tall, with
long, thin white hair, who was compelled by his infirmities to
support himself in walking with two staffs. Sarah Churchill, a
chief witness, against him, was a servant<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> in his
family; and probably was feeding in this way some old
grudge.</p>
<p>"You accuse me of being a wizard," said the
old man on his examination; "you might as well charge me with being
a buzzard."</p>
<p>They asked the accused to repeat the Lord's
prayer. And Master Parris, the minister, who acted as a reporter,
said "he could not repeat it right after many trials."</p>
<p>"Well," said the brave old man finally, after
they had badgered him with all kinds of nonsensical questions,
"Well, burn me, or hang me, I will stand in the truth of
Christ!"</p>
<p>As his manly bearing was evidently producing
an effect, the "afflicted girls" came out in full force the next
day at the adjourned session. When he was brought in, they fell at
once into the most grievous fits and screechings.</p>
<p>"Who hurts you?" was asked, after they had
recovered somewhat.</p>
<p>"This man," said Abigail Williams, going off
into another fit.</p>
<p>"This is the man," averred Ann Putnam; "he
hurts me, and wants me to write in the red book; and promises if I
will do so, to make me as well as his grand-daughter."<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg
75]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, this is the man," cried Mercy Lewis,
"he almost kills me."</p>
<p>"It is the one who used to come to me. I know
him by his two staffs, with one of which he used to beat the life
out of me," said Mary Walcott.</p>
<p>Mercy Lewis for her part walked towards him;
but as soon as she got near, fell into great fits.</p>
<p>Then Ann Putnam and Abigail Williams "had
each of them a pin stuck in their hands and they said it was done
by this old Jacobs."</p>
<p>The Magistrates took all this wicked acting
in sober earnest; and asked the prisoner, "what he had to say to
it?"</p>
<p>"Only that it is false," he replied. "I know
no more of it than the child that was born last night."</p>
<p>But the honest old man's denial went of
course, for nothing. Neither did Sarah Ingersoll's deposition made
a short time afterwards; in which she testified that "Sarah
Churchill came to her after giving her evidence, crying and
wringing her hands, and saying that she has belied herself and
others in saying she had set her hand to the Devil's book." She
said that "they had threatened her that if she did not say it, they
would put her in the dungeon along with Master
Burroughs."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg
76]</a></span></p>
<p>And that, "if she told Master Noyes, the
minister, but once that she had set her hand to the book, he would
believe her; but if she told him the truth a hundred times, he
would not believe her."</p>
<p>The truth no doubt is that Master Noyes,
Master Parris, Cotton Mather, and all the other ministers, with one
or two exceptions, having committed themselves fully to the
prosecution of the witches, would listen to nothing that tended to
prove that the principal witnesses were deliberate and malicious
liars; and that, so far as the other witnesses were concerned, they
were grossly superstitious and deluded persons.</p>
<p>No charity that is fairly clear-sighted, can
cover over the evidence of the "afflicted circle" with the mantle
of self-delusion. Self-delusion does not conceal pins, stick them
into its own body, and charge the accused person with doing it,
knowing that the accusation may be the prisoner's death. This was
done repeatedly by Mistress Ann Putnam, and her Satanic brood of
false accusers.</p>
<p>Sarah Churchill was no worse than the others,
judging by her remorse after she had helped to murder with her
lying tongue her venerable master and we have in the deposition of
Sarah Ingersoll, undoubted proof that she testified
falsely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg
77]</a></span></p>
<p>When Ann Putnam, Mercy Lewis and Mary Walcott
all united in charging little Dorcas Good&mdash;five years
old!&mdash;with biting, pinching and almost choking them; "showing
the marks of her little teeth on their arms, and the pins sticking
in their bodies, where they had averred she was piercing
them"&mdash;can any sane, clear-minded man or woman suppose it was
an innocent delusion, and not a piece of horribly wicked
lying?</p>
<p>When in open court some of the "afflicted"
came out of their fits with "their wrists bound together, by
invisible means," with "a real cord" so that "it could hardly be
taken off without cutting," was there not only deception, but
undeniable collusion of two or more in deception?</p>
<p>When an iron spindle was used by an alleged
"spectre" to torture a "sufferer," the said iron spindle not being
discernible by the by-standers until it became visible by being
snatched by the sufferer from the spectre's hand, was there any
self-delusion there? Was it not merely wicked imposture and cunning
knavery?</p>
<p>I defy any person possessing in the least a
judicial and accurate mind, to investigate the records of this
witchcraft delusion without coming to the conclusion that the
"afflicted girls," who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id=
"Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> led off in this matter, and were the
principal witnesses, continually testified to what they knew to be
utterly false. There is no possible excuse for them on the ground
of "delusion." However much we may recoil from the sad belief that
they testified in the large majority of cases to what they knew to
be entirely false, the facts of the case compel us with an
irresistible force to such an unhappy conclusion. When we are
positively certain that a witness, in a case of life or death, has
testified falsely against the prisoner again and again, is it
possible that we can give him or her the benefit of even a doubt as
to the animus of the testimony? The falsehoods I have referred to
were cases of palpable, unmistakable and deliberate lying. And the
only escape from considering it <i>wilful</i> lying, is to make a
supposition not much in accord with the temper of the present
times, that, having tampered with evil spirits, and invoked the
Devil continually during the long evenings of the preceding winter,
the prince of powers of the air had at last come at their call, and
ordered a legion of his creatures to take possession of the minds
and bodies that they had so freely offered to him. For certainly
there is no way of explaining the conduct of the
"afflicted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg
79]</a></span> circle" of girls and women, than by supposing either
that they were guilty of the most enormous wickedness, or else that
they were "possessed with devils."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id=

<h4>Dulcibel in Danger.</h4>
<p>The terrible excitement of these days was
enough to drive the more excitable portion of the inhabitants of
Salem almost crazy. The work of the house and of the farm was
neglected; a large number of suspected persons and their relatives
were sunk in the deepest grief, the families of some of the
imprisoned knew not where to get their daily food; for their
property was generally taken possession of by the officers of the
law at the time of the arrest, the accused being considered guilty
until they were proved to be innocent. Upon conviction of a capital
offence the property of the condemned was attainted, being
confiscated by the state; and the constables took possession at
once, in order that it might not be spirited away.</p>
<p>And no one outside of the circle of the
accusers knew whose turn might come next. Neither sex, nor age, nor
high character, as we have seen, was a bar against the malice, or
the wantonness of the "afflicted." The man or woman who had lived a
righteous life for over eighty years, the little child who wondered
what it all meant, the maiden whose<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> only fault might be to
have a jealous rival, all were alike in danger.</p>
<p>Especially were those in peril, however, who
dared to take the side of any of the accused, and express even the
faintest disbelief in the justice of the legal proceedings, or the
honesty of the witnesses. These would be surely singled out for
punishment. Again and again, had this been done until the voices of
all but the very boldest were effectually silenced. Those arrested
now, as a general thing, would confess at once to the truthfulness
of all the charges brought against them, and even invent still more
improbable stories of their own, as this mollified the accusers,
and they often would be let off with a solemn reprimand by the
magistrates.</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam and his male servants went
constantly armed; and two horses were kept saddled day and night,
in his stable. He never went to the village unaccompanied; and made
no secret of his determination to resist the arrest of himself or,
as he had phrased it, "any one within his gates," to the last drop
of his blood.</p>
<p>Living with the Goodman Buckley who had
leased the Burton property, was a hired man named Antipas Newton.
He was a good worker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id=
"Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> though now getting old, and had in one
sense been leased with the place by Dulcibel's father.</p>
<p>Antipas's history had been a sad one. Adopted
when left an orphan by a benevolent farmer who had no children, he
managed by diligence and strict economy to acquire by the age of
thirty, quite a comfortable property of his own. Then the old
couple that he called Father and Mother became converts to
Quakerism. Fined and imprisoned, deprived of their property, and,
after the expiration of their term of imprisonment, ordered to
leave the colony, they had been "harbored" by the man for whom they
had done so much in his early years.</p>
<p>Antipas was a person of limited intelligence,
but of strong affections and wide sympathies. Again and again, he
harbored these persecuted ones, who despite their whippings and
banishment would persist in returning to Salem. Finally, Antipas
himself was heavily fined, and his property sold to pay the fines.
His wife had died early, but a young daughter who kept his house in
order, and who had failed in her attendance at the church which was
engaged in persecuting her father, was also fined heavily. As her
father's property was all gone, and she had no money of<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> her
own, she could not pay the fine, and was put in prison, to be sent
to Barbados, and sold as a slave, that thus the fine might be
collected. But the anguish, and the exposure of her prison, were
too much for the young girl; and she died before means of
transportation could be found.</p>
<p>As a result of these persecutions, Antipas
became demented. As his insanity grew evident, the prosecutions
ceased; but he was still in danger of starvation, so few would give
him employment, both on account of his impaired mind, and of the
odium which attached to any friend of the abhorred
Quakers.</p>
<p>Captain Burton, Dulcibel's father, came to
the village at this time. He had been one of the sea-captains who
had indignantly refused to take the Southwick children, or any
other of the Salem children, to Barbados; and he pitied the poor
insane man, and gave him employment. Not only did he do this, but,
as we have said, made it an article of the lease of his property,
that the Buckleys should also keep Antipas as a farm
servant.</p>
<p>Antipas, to the general surprise of the
villagers had proved to be an excellent servant, notwithstanding
his insanity. Only on training days and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> other
periods of excitement, did his insanity obtrude itself. At all
other times he seemed to be a cheerful, simple-hearted, and very
capable and industrious "hand."</p>
<p>To Dulcibel, as was natural, Antipas always
manifested the greatest devotion. Her little black mare was always
groomed to perfection, he never being satisfied until he took a
white linen handkerchief that he kept for the purpose, and, passing
it over the mare's shining coat, saw that no stain or loose black
hair remained on it.</p>
<p>"You think that Mistress Dulcibel is an
angel, do you not?" said one of the female servants to him about
this time, a little scornfully.</p>
<p>"No, I know what she is," he replied. "Shall
I tell you&mdash;but if I do, you will not believe"&mdash;and he
looked at the girl a little doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I will," said the girl.</p>
<p>"Come here then and I will whisper it to you.
I heard the minister read about her once, she is the woman that is
'clothed with the sun and has the moon under her feet, and upon her
head a crown of twelve stars.'"</p>
<p>"That is wicked, Antipas. If Master Parris
heard that you said things like that, he would have you whipped and
put in the stocks."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id=
"Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>"Master Parris? you mean Beelzebub! I know
Beelzebub when I see him." And Antipas gave one of his unnatural,
insane laughs, which were getting very frequent of late.</p>
<p>For the general excitement was proving too
much for Antipas. Fie stopped frequently in his work, and muttered
to himself; and then laughed wildly, or shed tears. He talked about
the witches and the Devil and evil spirits, and the strange things
that he saw at night, in the insane fashion that characterized the
"afflicted children."</p>
<p>As for Dulcibel in these times, she kept
pretty much to herself, going out very little. As she could not
sympathize with the general gossip of the neighborhood, she
remained at home, and consequently had very few visitors. Joseph
Putnam called whenever he came to the village, which, as I have
stated, was but seldom; and Ellis Raymond came every few
days.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a courtship, I suppose; but one
of a very grave and serious character. The conversation generally
turned upon the exciting events continually occurring, some new
arrest, some new confession, some new and outrageously absurd
charges.</p>
<p>Master Raymond's hand, if anyone
accosted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg
86]</a></span> him suddenly, instinctively sought the hilt of his
rapier. He was better skilled in the use of that weapon than was
usual, and had no fear that he should be unable to escape from the
constables, if not taken at a disadvantage. Still, as that would
compel him to fly into the woods, and as it would separate him from
Dulcibel, he had been very careful not to express in public his
abhorrence of all the recent proceedings. I am afraid that he was
guilty of considerable dissimulation, even paying his court to some
of the "afflicted" maidens when he had the opportunity, with soft
words and handsome presents; and trying in this way to enlist a
party in his behalf, in case he or any of his friends should need
supporters.</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam censured him one day for his
double dealing, which was a thing not only out of Master Joseph's
line, but one which his frank and outspoken nature rendered it very
difficult for him to practise. But Raymond with his references to
King David's behavior towards Achish, King of Gath, and to certain
other scripture, especially Paul's being "all things to all men
that he might save all," was rather too weighty for Joseph, whose
forte was sensible assertion rather than ingenious argument. And so
Master Ray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg
87]</a></span>mond persevered in his course, feeling no more
compunction in deceiving the Salemites, as he said to himself, than
he would in deceiving and cheating a pack of savage wolves, who
were themselves arrayed in sheep's clothing.</p>
<p>Jethro Sands had of late shown a disposition
to renew his attentions to Dulcibel; but, after two or three
visits, in the last of which he had given the maiden the desired
opportunity, she had plainly intimated to him that the old state of
affairs between them could never be restored.</p>
<p>"I know the reason too," said Jethro, angrily
"it is all owing to that English popinjay, who rides about as if we
colonists were not fit to dust his pretty coat for him."</p>
<p>"He is a gentleman, and a friend of mine,"
replied Dulcibel warmly.</p>
<p>"Why do you not say a lover of yours, at
once?"</p>
<p>"You have no right to talk to me in that
manner. I will not endure it."</p>
<p>"You will not&mdash;how will you help it?" He
was now thoroughly angry, and all his native coarseness came to the
surface.</p>
<p>"I will show you," said Dulcibel, the Norse
blood of her father glowing in her face. "Good evening, Sir!" and
she left the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id=
"Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>Jethro had not expected such a quiet, but
effective answer. He sat twirling his thumbs, for awhile, hoping
that she would return. But realizing at last that she would not, he
took his departure in a towering anger. Of course this was the last
of his visits. But Dulcibel had made a deadly enemy.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate, for the maiden already
had many who disliked her among the young people of the village.
She was a superior person for one thing, and "gave herself airs,"
as some said. To be superior, without having wealth or an
acknowledged high social position, is always to be envied, and
often to be hated. Then again, Dulcibel dressed with more richness
and variety of costume than was usual in the Puritan villages. This
set many of the women, both young and old, against her. Her scarlet
bodice, especially, was a favorite theme for animadversion; some
even going so far as to call her ironically "the scarlet woman." It
is curious how unpopular a perfectly amiable, sweet-tempered and
sweet-tongued maiden may often become, especially with her own sex,
because of their innate feeling that she is not, in spite of all
her courteous endeavors, really one of them. It is an evil day for
the swan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg
89]</a></span> when she finds herself the only swan among a large
flock of geese.</p>
<p>Dulcibel's antecedents also were not as
orthodox as they might be. Her mother, it was granted, was "pious,"
and of a "godly" connection; but her father, as he had himself once
said, "had no religion to speak of." He had further replied to the
question, asked him when he first came to Salem, as to whether he
was "a professor of religion," that he was "only a sea captain, and
had no other profession." And a certain freedom of thought
characterized Dulcibel, that she could scarcely have derived from
her pious mother. In fact, it was something like the freedom of the
winds and of the clouds, blowing where they liked; and had been
probably caught up by her father in his many voyages over the
untrammeled seas.</p>
<p>At first Dulcibel had been rather impressed
by the sermons of Master Parris and Master Noyes and the other
ministers, to the effect that Satan was making a deadly assault
upon the "saints," in revenge for their interference with his
hitherto undisputed domination of the new world. But the longer she
thought about it, the more she was inclined to adopt Joseph
Putnam's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
90]</a></span> theory, that his sister-in-law and niece and the
other "afflicted" persons were possessed by devils.</p>
<p>She inclined to this view in preference even
to what she knew was Ellis Raymond's real conviction, that they
were a set of hysterical and vicious girls and women who had
rendered themselves half-insane by tampering for a whole winter
with their nervous and spiritual organizations; until they could
scarcely now distinguish the true from the untrue, the real from
the unreal, good from evil, or light from darkness.</p>
<p>"They have become reprobates and given over
to an evil mind," said Master Raymond to her one day; clothing his
thought as nearly as he could in scriptural language, in order to
commend it to her.</p>
<p>"Yes, this seems to be a reasonable
explanation of their wicked conduct," replied Dulcibel. "But I
think after all, that it amounts to about the same thing as Joseph
Putnam says, only that his is the stronger and more satisfactory
statement."</p>
<p>And thinking of it, Master Raymond had to
come to the same conclusion. His own view and that of his friends
were about the same, only they had expressed themselves in
different phrases.</p>

<h4>Bad News.</h4>
<p>The blow fell at last, and where they might
have expected it. As Joseph Putnam said afterwards, "Why did I not
bring them out to my house? They would not have dared to take them
from under my roof, and they could not have done it if they had
dared."</p>
<p>One of his servants had been sent to the
village on an errand; he had not performed his errand, but he had
hurried back at once with the news. Dulcibel Burton had been
arrested the previous evening, about nine o'clock, on the charge of
being a witch. Antipas Newton had also been arrested. Both had been
taken to prison, and put in irons.</p>
<p>A desperate, determined look came into the
faces of the two men as they gathered every word the servant had to
tell. Young Mistress Putnam burst into tears. But the men dashed a
tear or two from their eyes, and began to collect their thoughts.
It was not weeping but stern daring, that would be needed before
this thing was through.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id=
"Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>The prisoners were to be brought up that
afternoon for examination. "I have my two men, who will follow
wherever I lead them," said Master Putnam. "That makes four of us.
Shall we carry her off from under their very eyes?" And his face
glowed&mdash;the fighting instinct of his race was very strong
within him.</p>
<p>"It might not succeed, those men are neither
cowards nor babies," answered his guest. "Besides, it would lead
probably to your banishment and the confiscation of your property.
No, we must have the wisdom of the serpent, as well as the boldness
of the lion."</p>
<p>"The result of the examination may be
favorable, so young and good and beautiful as she is," said
Mistress Putnam.</p>
<p>"They lap their tongues in the blood of
lambs, and say it is sweet as honey," replied her husband, shaking
his head. "No, they will show no mercy; but we must try to match
them."</p>
<p>"Yes, and with as little hazard and cost to
you, my noble friend, as possible," said Master Raymond. "Let me
act, and take all the risk. They cannot get hold of my property;
and I would just as lief live in New York or Philadelphia or
England as among this brood of crazy vipers."<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg
93]</a></span></p>
<p>"That is wise counsel, Joseph," said his
wife.</p>
<p>"Oh, I suppose it is," he answered
emphatically. "But I hate wise counsel."</p>
<p>"Still, my good friend, you must admit that,
as Dulcibel betrothed herself to me only two days ago, I am the one
to take the greatest risk in this matter."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" said Mistress Putnam. "I knew it
would be so; and I told Joseph it would be, only
yesterday."</p>
<p>"I give you joy of such a mistress!" cried
Master Putnam, grasping his friend's hand. "Yes, I grant now your
right of precedence in this danger, and I will follow your
lead&mdash;yes, to the death!"</p>
<p>"I hold you to that," said Master Raymond.
"Remember you are pledged to follow my lead. Now, whatever I do, do
not wonder, much less express any wonder. For this is war, and I
have a right to meet craft with craft, and guile with guile. Depend
upon it, I will save her, or perish with her."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id=
"Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
<h4>The Arrest of Dulcibel and
Antipas.</h4>
<p>The arrest of Dulcibel had been entirely
unexpected to herself and the Buckleys. Dulcibel indeed had
wondered, when walking through the village in the morning, that
several persons she knew had seemed to avoid meeting her. But she
was too full of happiness in her recent betrothal to take umbrage
or alarm at such an unimportant circumstance. A few months now, and
Salem, she hoped, would see her no more forever. She knew, for
Master Raymond had told her, that there were plenty of places in
the world where life was reasonably gay and sunny and hopeful; not
like this dull valley of the shadow of death in which she was now
living. Raymond's plan was to get married; sell her property, which
might take a few months, more or less; and then sail for England,
to introduce his charming wife to a large circle of
relatives.</p>
<p>Dulcibel had been reading a book that Raymond
had brought to her&mdash;a volume of Shakespeare's plays&mdash;a
prohibited book among the Puritan fathers, and which would have
been made the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id=
"Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> text for one of Master Parris's most
denunciatory sermons if he had known that it was in the village.
Having finished "Macbeth" she laid the book down upon the table and
began playing with her canary, holding it to her cheek, putting its
bill to her lips, and otherwise fondling it. While she was thus
engaged, she began to have the uncomfortable feeling which
sensitive persons often have when some one is watching them; and
turning involuntarily to the window which looked out on a garden at
the side of the house, she saw in the dim light that dark faces,
with curious eyes, seemed nearly to fill up the lower half of the
casement. In great surprise, and with a sudden tremor, she rose
quickly from the seat; and, as she did so, the weird faces and
glistening eyes disappeared, and two constables, attended by a
crowd of the villagers, entered the room. One of these walked at
once to her side, and seizing her by the arm said, "I arrest you,
Dulcibel Burton, by the authority of Magistrate Hathorne. Come
along with me."</p>
<p>"What does all this mean, friend Herrick?"
said Goodman Buckley, coming into the room.</p>
<p>"It means," said the constable, "that this
young woman is no better than the other witches,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> who
have been joining hand with Satan against the peace and dignity of
this province." Then, turning to Dame Buckley, "Get her a shawl and
bonnet, goodwife; if you do not wish her to go out unprotected in
the night's cold."</p>
<p>"A witch&mdash;what nonsense!" said Dame
Buckley.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, is it?" said the other constable.
"What is this?" taking up the book from the table. "A book of
plays! profane and wicked stage plays, in Salem village! You had
better hold your peace, goodwife; or you may go to prison yourself
for harboring such licentious devices of Satan in your
house."</p>
<p>Goodwife Buckley started and grew pale. A
book of wicked stage-plays under her roof! She could make no reply,
but went off without speaking to pack up a bundle of the accused
maiden's clothing.</p>
<p>"See here!" continued the constable, opening
the book, "All about witches, as I thought! He-cat and three other
witches!</p>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">'Round about
the cauldron go:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">In the poisoned entrails
throw.'</span><br />
<p>It is horrible!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id=
"Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>"Put the accursed book in the fire,
Master Taunton," said Herrick.</p>
<p>There was a small fire burning on the hearth,
for the evening was a little cool, and the other constable threw
the book amidst the live coals; but was surprised to see that it
did not flame up rapidly.</p>
<p>"That is witchcraft, if there ever was
witchcraft!" said Jethro Sands, who was at the front of the crowd.
"See, it will not burn. The Devil looks out for his
own."</p>
<p>"Yes, we shall have to stay here all night,
if we wait for that book to burn up," said Master Herrick. "Now if
it had been a Bible, or a Psalm-book, it would have been consumed
by this time."</p>
<p>"My father told me," said one of the crowd,
"that they were once six weeks trying to burn up some witch's book
in Holland, and then had to tear each leaf separately before they
could burn it."</p>
<p>"Where is the yellow bird&mdash;her
familiar&mdash;that she was sending on some witch's errand when we
were watching at the window?" said another of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's not likely you will find the yellow
bird," replied Herrick. "It is halfway down to hell by this
time."</p>
<p>"No, there it is!" cried Jethro Sands,
pointing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg
98]</a></span> to a ledge over the door, where the canary-bird had
flown in its fright.</p>
<p>"Kill it! kill the familiar! Kill the devil's
imp!" came in various voices, the angry tones being not without an
inflection of fear.</p>
<p>Several pulled out their rapiers. Jethro was
the quickest. He made a desperate lunge at the little creature, and
impaled it on the point of his weapon.</p>
<p>Dulcibel shook off the hold of the constable
and sprang forward. "Oh, my pretty Cherry," she cried, taking the
dead bird from the point of the rapier. "You wretch! to harm an
innocent little creature like that!" and she smoothed the feathers
of the bird and kissed its little head.</p>
<p>"Take it from her! kill the witch!" cried
some rude women in the outer circles of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Yes, mistress, this is more than good
Christian people can be expected to endure," said constable
Herrick, sternly, snatching the bird from her and tossing it into
the fire. "Let us see if the imp will burn any quicker than the
book."</p>
<p>"Ah, she forgot to charm it," said the other
constable, as the little feathers blazed up in a blue
flame.</p>
<p>"Yes, but note the color," said Jethro. "No
Christian bird ever blazed in that color."<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg
99]</a></span></p>
<p>"Neither they ever did!" echoed another, and
they looked into each other's faces and shook their heads
solemnly.</p>
<p>At this moment Antipas Newton was led to the
door of the room, in the custody of another officer. The old man
seemed to be taking the whole proceeding very quietly and
patiently, as the Quakers always did. But the moment he saw
Dulcibel weeping, with Herrick's grasp upon her arm, his whole
demeanor changed.</p>
<p>"What devil's mischief is this?" cried the
demented man; and springing like an enraged lion upon Master
Herrick, he dashed him against the opposite wall, tore his
constable's staff from his hands and laying the staff around him
wildly and ferociously cleared the room of everybody save Dulcibel
and himself in less time than I have taken to tell it.</p>
<p>Jethro stepped forward with his drawn rapier
to cover the retreat of the constables; but shouting, "the sword of
the Lord and of Gideon!" the deranged man, with the stout oaken
staff, dashed the rapier from Jethro's hand, and administered to
him a sounding whack over the head, which made the blood come. Then
he picked up the rapier and throwing the staff behind him,
laughed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg
100]</a></span> wildly as he saw the crowd, constable and all,
tumbling out of the door of the next room into the front garden of
the house as if Satan himself in very deed, were after
them.</p>
<p>"I will teach them how they abuse my pretty
little Dulcibel," said the now thoroughly demented man, laughing
grimly. "Come on, ye imps of Satan, and I will toast you at the end
of my fork," he cried, flourishing Jethro's rapier, whose red
point, crimson with the blood of the canary-bird, seemed to act
upon the mind of the old man as a spark of fire upon
tow.</p>
<p>"Antipas," said Dulcibel, coming forward and
gazing sadly into the eyes of her faithful follower, "is it not
written, 'Put up thy sword; for he that takes the sword shall
perish by the sword'? Give me the weapon!"</p>
<p>The old man gazed into her face, at first
wonderingly; then, with the instinct of old reverence and
obedience, he handed the rapier to her, crossed his muscular arms
over his broad breast, bowed his grisly head, and stood
submissively before her.</p>
<p>"You can return now safely," Dulcibel called
out to the constables. They came in, at first a little warily. "He
is insane; but the spell is over<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> now for the present.
But treat him tenderly, I pray you. When he is in one of these
fits, he has the strength of ten men."</p>
<p>The constables could not help being impressed
favorably by the maiden's conduct; and they treated her with a
certain respect and tenderness which they had not previously shown,
until they had delivered her, and the afterwards entirely humble
and peaceful Antipas, to the keeper of Salem prison.</p>
<p>But the crowd said to one another as they
sought their houses: "What a powerful witch she must be, to calm
down that maniac with one word." While others replied, "But he is
possessed with a devil; and she does it because her power is of the
devil."</p>
<p>They did not remember that this was the very
course of reasoning used on a somewhat similar occasion against the
Savior himself in Galilee!</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id=

<h4>Dulcibel in Prison.</h4>
<p>In the previous cases of alleged witchcraft
to which I have alluded, the details given in my manuscript volume
were fully corroborated, even almost to the minutest particulars,
by official records now in existence. But in what I have related,
and am about to relate, relative to Dulcibel Burton, I shall have
to rely entirely upon the manuscript volume. Still, as there is
nothing there averred more unreasonable and absurd than what is
found in the existing official records, I see no reason to doubt
the entire truthfulness of the story. In fact, it would be
difficult to imagine grosser and more ridiculous accusations than
were made by Mistress Ann Putnam against that venerable and truly
devout and Christian matron, Rebecca Nurse.</p>
<p>When Dulcibel and Antipas, in the custody of
four constables, reached the Salem jail, it was about eleven
o'clock at night. The jailor, evidently had expected them; for he
threw open the door at once. He was a stout, strong-built man, with
not a bad countenance for a jailer;<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> but seemed thoroughly
imbued with the prevailing superstition, judging by the harsh
manner in which he received the prisoners.</p>
<p>"I've got two strong holes for these imps of
Satan; bring 'em along!"</p>
<p>The jail was built of logs, and divided
inside into a number of small rooms or cells. In each of these
cells was a narrow bedstead and a stone jug and slop bucket.
Antipas was hustled into one cell, and, after being chained, the
door was bolted upon him. Then Dulcibel was taken into another,
though rather larger cell, and the jailor said, "Now she will not
trouble other people for a while, my masters."</p>
<p>"Are you not going to put irons on her,
Master Foster?" said Herrick.</p>
<p>"Of course I am. But I must get heavier
chains than those to hold such a powerful witch as she is. Trust
her to me, Master Herrick. She'll be too heavy to fly about on her
broomsticks by the time I have done with her."</p>
<p>Then they all went out and Dulcibel heard the
heavy bolt shoot into its socket, and the voices dying away as the
men went down the stairs.</p>
<p>She groped her way to the bed in the
darkness, sat down upon it and burst into tears. It was<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> like
a change from Paradise into the infernal regions. A few hours
before and she had been musing in an ecstasy of joy over her
betrothal, and dreaming bright dreams of the future, such perhaps
as only a maiden can dream in the rapture of her first love. Now
she was sitting in a prison cell, accused of a deadly crime, and
her life and good reputation in the most imminent danger. One thing
alone buoyed her up&mdash;the knowledge that her lover was fully
aware of her innocence; and that he and Joseph Putnam would do all
that they could do in her behalf. But then the sad thought came,
that to aid her in any way might be only to bring upon themselves a
similar accusation. And then, with a noble woman's spirit of
self-sacrifice, she thought: "No, let them not be brought into
danger. Better, far better, that I should suffer alone, than drag
down my friends with me."</p>
<p>Here she heard the noise of the bolt being
withdrawn, and saw the dim light of the jailer's candle.</p>
<p>As the jailer entered he threw down some
heavy irons in the corner of the room. Then, he closed the door
behind him, and came up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105"
id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> the unhappy girl. He laid his
hand upon her shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"You little witch!"</p>
<p>Something in the tone seemed to strike upon
the maiden's ear as if it were not unfamiliar to her; and she
looked up hastily.</p>
<p>"Do you not remember me, little Dulcy? Why I
rocked you on my foot in the old Captain's house in Boston many a
day."</p>
<p>"Is it not uncle Robie?" said the girl. She
had not seen him since she was four years old.</p>
<p>The jailer smiled. "Of course it is," he
replied, "just uncle Robie. The old captain never went to sea that
Robie Foster did not go as first mate. And a blessed day it was
when I came to be first mate of this jail-ship; though I never
thought to see the old captain's bonnie bird among my
boarders."</p>
<p>"And do you think I really am a witch, uncle
Robie?"</p>
<p>"Of course ye are. A witch of the worst
kind," replied Robie, with a chuckle. "Now, when I come in here
tomorrow morning nae doobt I will find all your chains off. It is
just sae with pretty much all the others. I cannot keep them
chained, try my best and prettiest."<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>"And Antipas?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he will just be like all the rest of
them, doobtless. He is a powerful witch, and half a Quaker,
besides."</p>
<p>"But do you really believe in witches, uncle
Robie?"</p>
<p>"What do these deuced Barebones Puritans know
about witches, or the devil, or anything else? There is only one
true church, Mistress Dulcibel. I have sa mooch respect for the
clergy as any man; but I don't take my sailing orders from a set of
sourfaced old pirates."</p>
<p>Then, leaving her a candle and telling her to
keep up a stout heart, the jailer left the cell; and Dulcibel heard
the heavy bolt again drawn upon her, with a much lighter heart,
than before. Examining the bundle of clothes that Goodwife Buckley
had made up, she found that nothing essential to her comfort had
been forgotten, and she soon was sleeping as peacefully in her
prison cell as if she were in her own pretty little
chamber.</p>

<h4>Dulcibel before the Magistrates.</h4>
<p>The next afternoon the meeting-house at Salem
village was crowded to its utmost capacity; for Dulcibel Burton and
Antipas Newton were to be brought before the worshipful
magistrates, John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin. These worthies were
not only magistrates, but persons of great note and influence,
being members of the highest legislative and judicial body in the
Province of Massachusetts Bay.</p>
<p>Among the audience were Joseph Putnam and
Ellis Raymond; the former looking stern and indignant, the latter
wearing an apparently cheerful countenance, genial to all that he
knew, and they were many; and especially courteous and agreeable to
Mistress Ann Putnam, and the "afflicted" maidens. It was evident
that Master Raymond was determined to preserve for himself the
freedom of the village, if complimentary and pleasant speeches
would effect it. It would not do to be arrested or banished, now
that Dulcibel was in prison.</p>
<p>When the constable, Joseph Herrick,
brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg

search for images and such like," they had found a "yellow bird,"
of the kind that witches were known to affect; a wicked book of
stage-plays, which seemed to be about witches, especially one
called "he-cat"; and a couple of rag dolls with pins stuck into
them.</p>
<p>"Have you brought them?" said Squire
Hathorne.</p>
<p>"We killed the yellow bird and threw it and
the wicked book into the fire."</p>
<p>"You should not have done that; you should
have produced them here."</p>
<p>"We can get the book yet; for it was lying
only partly burned near the back-log. It would not burn, all we
could do to it."</p>
<p>"Of course not. Witches' books never burn,"
said Squire Hathorne.</p>
<p>"Here are the images," said a constable,
producing two little rag-babies, that Dulcibel was making for a
neighbor's children.</p>
<p>The crowd looked breathlessly on as "these
diabolical instruments of torture" were placed upon the table
before the magistrates.</p>
<p>"Dulcibel Burton, stand up and look upon your
accusers," said Squire Hathorne.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>Dulcibel had sunk upon a bench while the
above conversation was going on&mdash;she felt overpowered by the
curious and malignant eyes turned upon her from all parts of the
room. Now she rose and faced the audience, glancing around to see
one loved face. At last her eyes met his; he was standing erect,
even proudly; his arms crossed over his breast, his face composed
and firm, his dark eyes glowing and determined. He dared not utter
a word, but he spoke to her from the inmost depths of his soul: "Be
firm, be courageous, be resolute!"</p>
<p>This was what Raymond meant to say; and this
is what Dulcibel, with her sensitive and impassioned nature,
understood him to mean. And from that moment a marked change came
over her whole appearance. The shrinking, timid girl of a moment
before stood up serene but heroic, fearless and undaunted; prepared
to assert the truth, and to defy all the malice of her enemies, if
need be, to the martyr's death.</p>
<p>And she had need of all her courage. For,
before three minutes had passed&mdash;Squire Hathorne pausing to
look over the deposition on which the arrest had been
made&mdash;Mistress Ann Putnam shrieked out, "Turn her head away,
she is tor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id=
"Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>menting us! See, her yellow-bird is
whispering to her!" And with that, she and her little daughter Ann,
and Abigail Williams and Sarah Churchill and Leah Herrick and
several others, flung themselves down on the floor in apparent
convulsions.</p>
<p>"Oh, a snake is stinging me!" cried Leah
Herrick.</p>
<p>"Her black horse is trampling on my breast!"
groaned Sarah Churchill.</p>
<p>"Make her look away; turn her head!" cried
several in the crowd. And one of the constables caught Dulcibel by
the arm, and turned her around roughly.</p>
<p>"This is horrible!" cried Thomas
Putnam&mdash;"and so young and fair-looking, too!"</p>
<p>"Ah, they are the worst ones, Master Putnam,"
said his sympathetic friend, the Rev. Master Parris.</p>
<p>"She looks young and pretty, but she may
really be a hundred years old," said deacon Snuffles.</p>
<p>Quiet at last being restored, Magistrate
Hathorne said:</p>
<p>"Dulcibel Burton, why do you torment Mistress
Putnam and these others in this grievous fashion?"</p>
<p>"I do not torment them," replied Dulcibel
calmly, but a little scornfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>"Who does torment them, then?"</p>
<p>"How should I know&mdash;perhaps
Satan."</p>
<p>"What makes you suppose that Satan torments
them?"</p>
<p>"Because they tell lies."</p>
<p>"Do you know that Satan cannot torment these
people except through the agency of other human beings?"</p>
<p>"No, I do not."</p>
<p>"Well, he cannot&mdash;our wisest ministers
are united upon that. Is it not so, Master Parris?"</p>
<p>"That is God's solemn truth," was the
reply.</p>
<p>"Who is it that torments you, Mistress
Putnam?" continued Squire Hathorne, addressing Mistress Ann Putnam,
who had sent so many already to prison and on the way to
death.</p>
<p>Mistress Putnam was angered beyond measure at
Dulcibel's intimation that she and her party were instigated and
tormented directly by the devil. And yet she could not, if she
would, bear falser witness than she already had done against
Rebecca Nurse and other women of equally good family and
reputation. But at this appeal of the Magistrate, she flung her
arms into the air, and spoke with the vehemence and excitement of a
half-crazy woman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id=
"Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is she, Dulcibel Burton. She was a witch
from her very birth. Her father sold her to Satan before she was
born, that he might prosper in houses and lands. She has the
witch's mark&mdash;a snake&mdash;on her breast, just over her
heart. I know it, because goodwife Bartley, the midwife, told me so
three years ago last March. Midwife Bartley is dead; but have a
jury of women examine her, and you will see that it is
true."</p>
<p>At this, as all thought it, horrible charge,
a cold thrill ran through the crowd. They all had heard of
witch-marks, but never of one like this&mdash;the very serpent,
perhaps, which had deluded Eve. Joseph Putnam smiled disdainfully.
"A set of stupid, superstitious fools!" he muttered through his
teeth. "Half the De Bellevilles had that mark."<a name=
"FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p>"I will have that looked into," said Squire
Hathorne. "In what shape does the spectre come, Mistress
Putnam?"</p>
<p>"In the shape of a yellow-bird. She whispers
to it who it is that she wants tormented, and it comes and pecks at
my eyes."</p>
<p>Here she screamed out wildly, and began as if
defending her eyes from an invisible assailant.</p>
<p>"It is coming to me now," cried Leah Herrick,
striking out fiercely.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id=
"Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
"Oh, do drive it away!" shrieked Sarah
Churchill, "it will put out our eyes."<br />
<br />
<p>There was a scene of great excitement,
several men drawing their swords and pushing and slashing at the
places where they supposed the spectral bird might be.</p>
<p>Leah Herrick said the spectre that hurt her
came oftenest in the shape of a small black horse, like that which
Dulcibel Burton was known to keep and ride. Everybody supposed, she
said, that the horse was itself a witch, for it was perfectly
black, with not a white hair on it, and nobody could ride it but
its mistress.</p>
<p>Here Sarah Churchill said she had seen
Dulcibel Burton riding about twelve o'clock one night, on her black
horse, to a witches' meeting.</p>
<p>Ann Putnam, the child, said she had seen the
same thing. One curious thing about it was that Dulcibel had
neither a saddle nor a bridle to ride with. She thought this was
very strange; but her mother told her that witches always rode in
that manner.</p>
<p>Here the two ministers of Salem, Rev. Master
Parris and Rev. Master Noyes, said that this was<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
undeniably true, that it was a curious fact that witches never used
saddles nor bridles. Master Noyes explaining further that there was
no necessity for such articles, as the familiar was instantly
cognizant of every slightest wish or command of the witch to whom
he was subject, and going thus through the air, there being no
rocks or gullies or other rough places, there was no necessity of a
saddle. Both the magistrates and the people seemed to be very much
instructed by the remarks of these two godly ministers.</p>
<p>That "pious and excellent young man," Jethro
Sands, here came forward and testified as follows: He had been at
one time on very intimate terms with the accused; but her conduct
on one occasion was so very singular that he declined thereafter to
keep company with her. Hearing one day that she had gone to Master
Joseph Putnam's, he had walked up the road to meet her on her
return to the village. He looked up after walking about a mile, and
saw her coming towards him on a furious gallop. There seemed to
have been a quarrel of some kind between her and her familiar, for
it would not stop all she could do to it. As she came up to him she
snatched a rod that he had cut in the woods, out of his hand, and
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg
115]</a></span> moment the familiar stopped and became as
submissive as a pet dog. He could not understand what it meant,
until it suddenly occurred to him that the rod was a branch of
witch-hazel!</p>
<p>Here the audience drew a long breath, the
whole thing was satisfactorily explained. Every one knew the
magical power of witch-hazel.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=
"FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p>Jethro further testified that Mistress
Dulcibel freely admitted to him that her horse was a witch; never
speaking of the mare in fact but as a "little witch." As might be
expected, the horse was a most vicious animal, worth nothing to
anybody save one who was a witch himself. He thought it ought to be
stoned, or otherwise killed, at once.</p>
<p>The Rev. Master Noyes suggested that if it
were handed over to his reverend brother Parris, he might be able,
by a course of religious exercises, to cast out the evil spirit and
render the animal serviceable. The apostles and disciples, it would
be remembered, often succeeded in casting out evil spirits; though
sometimes, we are told, they lamentably failed.</p>
<p>The magistrates here consulted a few minutes,
and Squire Hathorne then ordered that the black <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>mare
should be handed over to the Rev. Master Parris for his use, and
that he might endeavor to exorcise the evil spirit that possessed
it.</p>
<p>Dulcibel had regarded with calm and serious
eyes the concourse around her while this wild evidence was being
given. Notwithstanding the peril of her position, she could not
avoid smiling occasionally at the absurdity of the charges made
against her; while at other times her brow and cheeks glowed with
indignation at the maliciousness of her accusers. Then she thought,
how could I ever have injured these neighbors so seriously that
they have been led to conspire together to take my life? Oh, if I
had never come to Salem, to a place so overflowing with malice,
evil-speaking and all uncharitableness! Where there was so much
sanctimonious talk about religion, and such an utter absence of it
in those that prated the most of its possession. Down among the
despised Quakers of Pennsylvania there was not one-half as much
talking about religion but three times as much of that kindly
charity which is its essential life.</p>
<p>"Dulcibel Burton," said Squire Hathorne, "you
have heard what these evidence against you; what answer can you
make to them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id=
"Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>Blood will assert itself. The daughter of the
old sea-captain, himself of Norse descent on the mother's side,
felt her father's spirit glowing in her full veins.</p>
<p>"The charges that have been made are too
absurd and ridiculous for serious denial. The 'yellow bird' is my
canary bird, Cherry, given me by Captain Alden when we lived in
Boston. He brought it home with him from the West Indies. Ask him
whether it is a familiar. My black horse misbehaved on that
afternoon Jethro Sands tells of, as I told him at the time; simply
because I had no whip. When he gave me his switch, the vixenish
animal came at once into subjection to save herself a good
whipping. It was not a hazel switch, his statement is false, and he
knows it, it was a maple one."</p>
<p>"And you mean to say, I suppose," shrieked
out Mistress Ann Putnam, "that you have no witch-mark either; that
you do not carry the devil's brand of a snake over your
heart?"</p>
<p>"I have some such mark, but it is a
birth-mark, and not a witch-mark. It is a simple curving line of
red," and the girl blushed crimson at being compelled to such a
reference to a personal peculiarity. But she faltered not in her
speech, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id=
"Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> her tones were more indignant than
before. "It is not a peculiarity of mine, but of my mother's
family. Some say that a distant ancestor was once frightened by a
large snake coming into her chamber; and her child was born with
this mark upon her breast. That is all of it. There is no necessity
of any examination, for I admit the charge."</p>
<p>"Yes," screamed Mistress Putnam again, "your
ancestress too was a noted witch. It runs in the family. Go away
with you!" she cried striking apparently at something with her
clenched hand. "It is her old great grandmother! See, there she is!
Off! Off! She is trying to choke me!" endeavoring seemingly to
unclasp invisible hands from her throat.</p>
<p>The other "afflicted" ones joined in the
tumult. With one it was the "yellow bird" pecking at her eyes, with
another the black horse rearing up and striking her with its hoofs.
Leah Herrick cried that Dulcibel's "spectre" was choking
her.</p>
<p>"Hold her hands still!" ordered Squire
Hathorne, and a constable sprang to each side of the accused maiden
and held her arms and hands in a grasp of iron.</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam made an exclamation
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg
119]</a></span> almost sounded like an oath, and made a step
forward; but a firm hand was laid upon his shoulder. "Be patient!"
whispered Ellis Raymond, though his own mouth was twitching
considerably. "We are the anvil now; wait till our turn comes to be
sledgehammer!"</p>
<p>Such a din and babel as the "afflicted" kept
up! By the curious power of sympathy it affected the crowd almost
to madness. If Dulcibel looked at them, they cried she was
tormenting them. If she looked upward in resignation to Heaven,
they also stared upwards with fixed, stiff necks. If she leaned her
head one side they did the same, until it seemed as if their necks
would be broken; and the jailers forced up Dulcibel's neck with
their coarse, dirty hands.</p>
<p>Dulcibel had not attended any of the other
examinations, but similar demonstrations on the part of the
"afflicted" had been described to her. It was very different,
however, to hear of such things and to experience them in her own
person. And if she had been at all a nervous and less healthy young
woman, she might have been overcome by them, and even led to admit,
as so many others had admitted under similar influences, that she
really was a witch, and compelled by her mas<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>ter,
the devil, could not help tormenting these poor victims.</p>
<p>"Why do you not cease this?" at last cried
Squire Hathorne, sternly and wrathfully.</p>
<p>"Cease what?" she replied
indignantly.</p>
<p>"Tormenting these poor, suffering children
and women!"</p>
<p>"You see I am not tormenting them. Bid these
men unloose my hands, they are hurting me."</p>
<p>"They say your spectre and your familiar are
tormenting them."</p>
<p>"They are bearing false witness against
me."</p>
<p>"Who does hurt them then?"</p>
<p>"Their master, the devil, I suppose and his
imps."</p>
<p>"Why should he hurt them?"</p>
<p>"Because they are liars, and bear false
witness; being hungry for innocent blood."</p>
<p>The spirit of the free-thinking, free-spoken
old sea-captain&mdash;nurtured by the free winds and the free waves
for forty years&mdash;was fully alive now in his daughter. A
righteous, holy indignation at the abominable farce that was going
on with all its gross lying and injustice had taken possession of
her, and she cared no longer for the opinions of any one around
her, and thought not even of her<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> lover looking on, but
only of truth and justice. "Yes, they are possessed with
devils&mdash;being children of their father, the devil!" she
continued scornfully. "And they shall have their reward. As for
you, Ann Putnam, in seven years from this day I summon you to meet
those you have slain with your wicked, lying tongue, at the bar of
Almighty God! It shall be a long dying for you!" Then, seeing
Thomas Putnam by his wife's side, "And you, Thomas Putnam, you
puppet in a bad woman's hands, chief aider and abettor of her
wicked ways, you shall die two weeks before her, to make ready for
her coming! And you," turning to the constables on each side of
her, "for your cruel treatment of innocent women, shall die by this
time next year!"</p>
<p>The constables loosened their grasp of her
hands and shrank back in dismay. The "afflicted" suddenly hushed
their cries and regained their composure, as they saw the accused
maiden's eyes, lit up with the wildness of inspiration, glancing
around their circle with lightning flashes that might strike at any
moment.</p>
<p>Even Squire Hathorne's wine-crimsoned face
paled, lest she would turn around and denounce him too. Even if she
were a witch, witches it was<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> known sometimes spoke
truly. And when she slowly turned and looked upon him, the haughty
judge was ready to sink to the floor.</p>
<p>"As for you, John Hathorne, for your part in
these wicked doings," here she paused as if waiting to hear a
supernatural voice, while the crowded meeting-house was quiet as a
tomb&mdash;"No! you are only grossly deluded; you shall not die.
But a curse shall be upon you and your descendants for a hundred
years. They shall not prosper. Then a Hathorne shall arise who
shall repudiate you and all your wicked works, and the curse shall
pass away!"</p>
<p>Squire Hathorne regained his courage the
instant she said he should not die, little he cared for misfortunes
that might come upon his descendants.</p>
<p>"Off with the witch to prison&mdash;we have
heard enough!" he cried hoarsely. "Tell the jailer to load her well
with irons, hands and feet; and give her nothing to eat but bread
and water of repentance. She is committed for trial before the
special court, in her turn, and at the worshipful judges'
convenience."</p>

<h4>Well, What Now?</h4>
<p>The crowd drew long breaths as they emerged
from the meeting-house. This was the first time that the accused
had fully turned upon the accusers. It was a pity that it had not
been done before; because such was the superstition of the day,
that to have your death predicted by one who was considered a witch
was no laughing matter. The blood ran cold even in Mistress Ann
Putnam's veins, as she thought of Dulcibel's prediction; and the
rest of the "afflicted" inwardly congratulated themselves that they
had escaped her malediction, and resolved that they would not be
present at her trial as witnesses against her, if they could
possibly avoid it. But then that might not be so easy.</p>
<p>Even the crowd of beholders were a little
more careful in the utterance of their opinions about Dulcibel than
they had been relative to the other accused persons. Not that they
had much doubt as to the maiden's being a born witch&mdash;the
serpent-mark seemed to most of them a conclusive proof of
that&mdash;but what if one of those "spectres,"<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> the
"yellow bird" or the uncontrollable "black mare" should be near and
listening to what they were even then saying?</p>
<p>"What do I think about it?" said one of the
crowd to his companion. "Why I think that if he who sups with the
devil should have a long spoon, he who abuses a witch should be
certain her yellow bird is not listening above his left shoulder,"
and he gave a quick glance in the direction alluded to, while half
of those near him, as they heard his warning words, did the same.
And there was not much talking against Dulcibel after this, among
that portion of the villagers.</p>
<p>Ellis Raymond had heard this speech as he
walked silently out of the meeting-house with Joseph Putnam, and a
grim smile flitted over his face. He felt prouder than ever of his
beautiful betrothed. He was not a man who admired amazons or other
masculine women, such, as in these days, we call "strong-minded;"
he liked a woman to keep in her woman's sphere, such as the Creator
had marked out for her by making her a woman; but circumstances may
rightly overrule social conventions, and demand action suitable to
the emergency. Standing at bay, among a pack of howling wolves, the
heroic is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id=
"Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> womanly as well as manly quality;
and the gun and the knife as feminine implements, as the needle and
the scissors. Dulcibel had never reasoned about such things; she
was a maiden who naturally shrank from masculine self-assertion and
publicity; but, called to confront a great peril, she was true to
the noble instincts of her family and her race, and could meet
falsehood with indignant denial and contempt. How she had been led
to utter those predictions she never fully understood&mdash;not at
the time nor afterwards. She seemed to herself to be a mere reed
through which some indignant angel was speaking.</p>
<p>"Well," said Joseph Putnam, as they got clear
of the crowd, "brother Thomas and sister Ann have wakened up the
tiger at last. They will be "afflicted" now in dead earnest. Did
you see how sister Ann, with all her assurance, grew pale and
almost fainted? It serves her right; she deserves it; and Thomas
too, for being such a dupe and fool."</p>
<p>"Do you think it will come true?" said Master
Raymond.</p>
<p>"Of course it will; the prediction will
fulfill itself. Thomas is superstitious beyond all reasonableness;
and good Mistress Ann, my pious<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> sister-in-law, is
almost as bad as he is, notwithstanding her lies and trickery. Do
you know what I saw that Leah Herrick doing?"</p>
<p>"What was it?"</p>
<p>"In her pretended spasms, when bending nearly
double, she was taking a lot of pins out of the upper edge of her
stomacher with her mouth, preparatory of course, to making the
accusation that it was Dulcibel's doings."</p>
<p>"But she did not?"</p>
<p>"No, it was just before the time that
Dulcibel scared them so with the predictions; and Leah was so
frightened, lest she also should be predicted against, that she
quietly spit all the pins into her hand again."</p>
<p>"Ah, that was the game played by a girl about
ten years ago at Taunton-Dean, in England. Judge North told my
father about it. One of the magistrates saw her do it."</p>
<p>"Well, now, what shall we do? They will
convict her just as surely as they try her."</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly!"</p>
<p>"Shall we attack and break open the jail some
dark night, sword in hand? I can raise a party of young men,
friends of the imprisoned, to do it; they only want a
leader."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg
127]</a></span></p>
<p>"And all of you go off into perpetual
banishment and have all your property confiscated?"</p>
<p>"I do not care. I am ready to do
it."</p>
<p>"If you choose to encounter such a risk for
others, I have no objection. I believe myself that if the friends
and relatives of the accused persons would take up arms in defense
of them, and demand their release, it would be the very manliest
and most sensible thing they could do. But the consciences of the
people here make cowards of them. They are all in bondage to a
blind and conceited set of ministers, and to a narrow and bigoted
creed."</p>
<p>"Then what do you plan?"</p>
<p>"Dulcibel's escape. You know that I managed
to see her for a few minutes early this morning. She has a friend
within the prison. Wait till we get on our horses, and I will
explain it all to you."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id=

<h4>Antipas Works a Miracle.</h4>
<p>The next morning Antipas Newton was brought
before the Magistrates for examination. Antipas seemed so quiet and
peaceful in his demeanor, that Squire Hathorne could hardly credit
the story told by the constables of his violent behavior on the
night of the arrest.</p>
<p>"I thought you were a Quaker," said he to the
prisoner.</p>
<p>"No, only half Quaker; the other half
gospeller," replied the old man meekly.</p>
<p>Mistress Ann was not present; her husband
brought report that she was sick in bed. Probably she did not care
to come, the game being too insignificant. Perhaps she had not
quite recovered from the stunning effect of Dulcibel's prediction.
Though it was not likely that a doom that was to be seven years in
coming, would, after the first impression was past, be felt very
keenly. There was time for so much to happen during seven
years.</p>
<p>But the Rev. Master Parris's little niece,
Abigail Williams, was present, and several other<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
older members of the "circle," prepared to witness against the old
man to any extent that seemed to be necessary.</p>
<p>After these had made their customary charges,
and had gone through some of their usual paroxysms, Joseph Putnam,
accompanied by Goodman Buckley, came forward.</p>
<p>"This is all folly," said Joseph Putnam
stoutly. "We all know Antipas Newton; and that he has been deranged
in his intellects, and of unsound mind for the last twenty years.
He is generally peaceful and quiet; though in times of excitement
like the present, liable to be driven into outbreaks of violent
madness. Here is his employer, Goodman Buckley, who of course knows
him best, and who will testify to all this even more conclusively
than I can."</p>
<p>Then Goodman Buckley took the oath with
uplifted hand, and gave similar evidence. No one had even doubted
for twenty years past, that Antipas was simple-minded. He often
said and did strange things; but only when everybody around him was
greatly excited, was he at all liable to violent outbreaks of
passion.</p>
<p>Squire Hathorne seemed half-convinced; but
the Reverend Master Parris rose from the bench<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
where he had been sitting, and said he would like to be heard for a
few moments. Permission being accorded: "What is insanity?" said
he. "What is the scriptural view of it? Is it anything but a
judgment of the Lord for sin, as in the case of Nebuchadnezzar; or
a possession by a devil, or devils, as in the Case of the Gadarene
who made his dwelling among the tombs as told in the fifth chapter
of Mark and the eighth of Luke? That these were real devils is
evident&mdash;for when permission was given them to enter into the
herd of swine, they entered into them, and the swine ran down a
steep place into the sea and were drowned. And as there were about
two thousand swine, there must have been at least two thousand
devils in that one so-called insane man; which no doubt accounted
for his excessive violence. After the devils had left him, we are
told that his countrymen came and saw him sitting at the feet of
Jesus, no longer naked, but clothed and in his right mind.
Therefore it follows as a logical deduction, that his not being
before in his right mind was because he was possessed with
devils."</p>
<p>The magistrates and people evidently were
greatly impressed with what Master Parris had said. And, as he sat
down, Master Noyes, who was sit<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>ting beside his
reverend brother, rose and said that he considered the argument
they had just heard unanswerable. It could only be refuted by
doubting the infallibility of the Scripture itself. And he would
further add, as to the case before them, that this so-called
insanity of the prisoner had not manifested itself until he had
been repeatedly guilty of harboring two of that heretical and
abominable sect called Quakers and had incurred imprisonment and
heavy fines for so doing; to pay which fines his property had been
rightfully sold. This punishment, and the death of his daughter by
the decree of a just God, apparently not being sufficient to
persuade him of the error of his ways, no doubt he had been given
over to the devil, that he might become a sign and a warning to
evil-doers. But, instead of repenting of his evil ways, he seems to
have entered the service of Captain Burton, who was always known to
be very loose in his religious views and observances; and who it
now seems was himself a witch, or, as he might be rather more
correctly termed, a wizard, and the father of the dangerous girl
who was properly committed for trial yesterday. Going thus downward
from bad to worse, this Antipas had at last become a witch himself;
roaming around tormenting godly<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> and unoffending people
to please his mistress and her Satanic master. In conclusion he
said that he fully agreed with his reverend brother, that what some
of the world's people, who thought themselves wise above that which
was written, called insanity, was simply, as taught in the holy
scriptures, a possession by the devil.</p>
<p>Magistrate Hathorne nodded to Magistrate
Corwin, and Magistrate Corwin nodded in turn decidedly to his
learned brother. They evidently considered that the ministers had
settled that point.</p>
<p>"Well, then," said Joseph Putnam, a little
roughly to the ministers, "why do you not do as the Savior did,
cast out the devils, that Antipas may sit down here in his right
mind? We do not read that any of these afflicted people in Judea
were cast into prison. In all cases they were pitied, not
punished."</p>
<p>"This is an unseemly interruption, Master
Putnam," said Squire Hathorne sternly. "We all know that the early
disciples were given the power to cast out devils and that they
exercised the power continually, but that in later times the power
has been withdrawn. If it were not so, our faithful elders would
cast out the spectres that are continually tormenting these poor
afflicted persons."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id=
"Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>While this discussion had been going on,
Antipas had been listening to all that was said with the greatest
attention. Once only had he manifested any emotion; that was when
the reference had been made to the death of his daughter, who had
died from her exposure to the severity of the winter season in
Salem jail. At this time he put his hand to his eyes and wiped away
a few tears. Before and after this, the expression of his face was
rather as of one who was pleased and amused at the idea of being
the center of attraction to such a large and goodly company. At the
conclusion of Squire Hathorne's last remark, a new idea seemed to
enter the old man's confused brain. He looked steadily at the line
of the "afflicted" before him, who were now beginning a new display
of paroxysms and contortions, and putting his right hand into one
of his pockets, he drew forth a coil of stout leather strap.
Grasping one end of it, he shouted, "I can heal them! I know what
will cure them!" and springing from between the two constables that
guarded him, began belaboring the "afflicted" with his strap over
their backs and shoulders in a very energetic fashion.</p>
<p>Dividing his energies between keeping off the
constable and "healing the afflicted," and aided<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
rather than hindered by Joseph Putnam's intentionally ill-directed
efforts to restrain him, the insane man managed to administer in a
short time no small amount of very exemplary punishment. And, as
Masters Putnam and Raymond agreed in talking over the scene
afterwards, he certainly did seem to effect an instantaneous cure
of the "afflicted," for they came to their sober senses at the
first cut of the leather strap, and rushed pell-mell down the
passage as rapidly as they could regardless of the other tormenting
"spectres."</p>
<p>"This is outrageous!" said Squire Hathorne
hotly to the constables as Antipas was at last overpowered by a
host of assailants, and stood now firmly secured and panting
between the two officers. "How dared you bring him here without
being handcuffed?"</p>
<p>"We had no idea of his breaking out anew, he
seemed as meek as a lamb," said constable Herrick.</p>
<p>"Why, we thought he was a Quaker!" added his
assistant.</p>
<p>"I am a Quaker!" said Antipas, looking a
little dangerous again.</p>
<p>"You are not."</p>
<p>"Thou liest!" said the insane man. "This is
one of my off days."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id=
"Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>Joseph Putnam laughed outright; and a few
others, who were not church-members, laughed with him.</p>
<p>"Silence!" thundered Squire Hathorne. "Is
this a time for idle levity?" and he glared around the
room.</p>
<p>"We have heard enough," continued the Squire,
after a few words with his colleague. "This is a dangerous man.
Take him off again to prison; and see that his chains are strong
enough to keep him out of mischief."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id=

<h4>Master Raymond Goes to Boston.</h4>
<p>Whatever the immediate effect of Dulcibel's
prediction had been, Mistress Ann Putnam was now about again, as
full of wicked plans, and as dangerous as ever. She knew, for
everybody knew, that Master Ellis Raymond had gone to Boston. In a
village like Salem at that time, such fact could hardly be
concealed.</p>
<p>"What had he gone for?</p>
<p>"To see a friend," Joseph Putnam had
said.</p>
<p>"What friend?" queried Mistress Ann. That
seemed important for her to know.</p>
<p>She had accused Dulcibel in the first place
as a means of hurting Joseph Putnam. But now since the trial, she
hated her for herself. It was not so much on account of the
prediction, as on account of Dulcibel's terrific arraignment of
her. The accusation that her husband was her dupe and tool was, on
account of its palpable truth, that which gave her perhaps the
greatest offence. The charge being once made, others might see its
truth also. Thus all the anger of her cunning, revengeful nature
was directed against Dulcibel.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>And just at this time she heard from a friend
in Boston, who sent her a budget of news, that Master Raymond had
taken dinner with Captain Alden. "Ah," she thought, "I see it now."
The name was a clue to her. Captain Alden was an old friend of
Captain Burton. He it was, so Dulcibel had said, from whom she had
the gift of the "yellow bird."</p>
<p>She knew Captain Alden by reputation. Like
the other seamen of the time he was superstitious in some
directions, but not at all in others. He would not for the world
leave port on a Friday&mdash;or kill a mother Carey's
chicken&mdash;or whistle at sea; but as to seeing witches in pretty
young girls, or sweet old ladies, that was entirely outside of the
average seaman's thoughts. Toward all women in fact, young or old,
pretty or ugly, every sailor's heart at that day, as in this,
warmed involuntarily.</p>
<p>She also knew that the seamen as a class were
rather inclined to what the godly called license in their religious
opinions. Had not the sea-captains in Boston Harbor, some years
before, unanimously refused to carry the young Quakeress, Cassandra
Southwick, and her brother, to the West Indies and sell them there
for slaves, to pay the fines incurred by their refusal to attend
church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg
138]</a></span> regularly? Had not one answered for the rest, as
paraphrased by a gifted descendant of the
Quakers?&mdash;</p>
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">"Pile my ship
with bars of silver&mdash;pack with coins of Spanish
gold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">From keelpiece up to deck-plank
the roomage of her hold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">By the living God who made me! I
would sooner in your bay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Sink ship and crew and cargo,
than bear this child away!"</span><br />
<p>And so Master Raymond, who it was rumored had
been a great admirer of Dulcibel Burton, was on a visit to Boston,
to see her father's old friend, Captain John Alden! Mistress Putnam
thought she could put two and two together, if any woman could. She
would check-mate that game&mdash;and with one of her boldest
strokes, too&mdash;that should strike fear into the soul of even
Joseph Putnam himself, and teach him that no one was too high to be
above the reach of her indignation.</p>
<p>The woman was so fierce in this matter, that
I sometimes have questioned, could she ever have loved and been
scorned by Joseph Putnam?</p>

<h4>A Night Interview.</h4>
<p>A few days passed and Master Raymond was back
again; with a pleasant word and smile for all he met, as he rode
through the village. Mistress Ann Putnam herself met him on the
street and he pulled up his horse at the side-path as she stopped,
and greeted her.</p>
<p>"So you have been to Boston?" she
said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I thought I would take a little turn
and hear what was going on up there."</p>
<p>"Who did you see&mdash;any of our
people?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;the Nortons and the Mathers
and the Higginsons and the Sewalls&mdash;I don't know
all.</p>
<p>"Good day; remember me to my kind brother
Joseph and his wife," said she, and Raymond rode on.</p>
<p>"What did that crafty creature wish to find
out by stopping me?" he thought to himself.</p>
<p>"He did not mention Captain Alden. Yes, he
went to consult him," thought Mistress Putnam.</p>
<p>Master Joseph Putnam was so anxious to meet
his friend, that he was standing at the turning in the lane that
led up to his house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id=
"Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, what did the Captain say?"</p>
<p>"He was astounded. Then he gave utterance to
some emphatic expressions about hell-fire and damnation which he
had probably heard in church."</p>
<p>"I know no more appropriate occasion to use
them," commented young Master Joseph drily. "If it were not for
certain portions of the psalms and the prophets, I could hardly get
through the time comfortably nowadays."</p>
<p>"If we can get her safely to Boston, he will
see that a fast vessel is ready to take us to New York; and he will
further see that his own vessel&mdash;the Colony's rather, which he
commands&mdash;never catches us."</p>
<p>"That looks well. I managed to see Dulcibel
for a few minutes to-day, and"&mdash;</p>
<p>"How is she?" inquired Raymond eagerly. "Does
she suffer much?"</p>
<p>"Not very much I think. No more than is
necessary to save appearances. She told me that the jailer was
devoted to her. He will meet you to-night after dark on the hill,
to arrange matters."</p>
<p>"Say that we get from the prison by midnight.
Then it will take at least three hours riding to reach
Boston&mdash;though we shall not enter the town."<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg
141]</a></span></p>
<p>"Three hours! Yes, four," commented his
friend; "or even five if the night be dark and stormy; and such a
night has manifest advantages. Still, as I suppose you must wait
for a northwest wind, that is pretty sure to be a clear
one."</p>
<p>"Yes, the main thing is to get out into the
open sea. Captain Alden plans to procure a Danish vessel, whose
skipper once out of sight of land, will oppose any recapture by
force."</p>
<p>"I suppose however you will sail for New
York?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is the nearest port and we shall
be perfectly safe there. Still Jamestown would do. The Delaware is
nearer than the James, but I am afraid the Quakers would not be
able to protect us, as they are too good to oppose force by
force."</p>
<p>"Too good! too cranky!" said Master Putnam.
"A pretty world the rascals would make of it, if the honest men
were too good to fight. It seems to me there is something
absolutely wicked in their non-resistant notions."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is no worse to kill a two-legged
tiger or wolf than a four-legged one; one has just as good a right
to live as the other."</p>
<p>"A better, I think," replied Master Putnam.
"The tiger or wolf is following out his proper nature; the human
tiger or wolf is violating his."<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<p>"You know I rather like the Quakers,"
rejoined Master Raymond. "I like their general idea of considering
the vital spirit of the Scripture more than the mere outward
letter. But in this case, it seems to me, they are in bondage to
the mere letter 'thou shalt not kill;' not seeing that to kill, in
many cases, is really to save, not only life, but all that makes
life valuable."</p>
<p>That evening just about dusk, the two young
men mounted their horses, and rode down one of the roads that led
to Salem town, leaving Salem village on the right&mdash;thinking
best not to pass through the village. Within a mile or so of the
town, Master Putnam said, "here is the place" and led the way into
a bridle path that ran into the woods. In about five minutes he
halted again, gave a low whistle, and a voice said, a short
distance from them, "Who are you, strangers?"</p>
<p>"Friends in need," replied Master
Putnam.</p>
<p>"Then ye are friends indeed," said the voice;
and Robert Foster, the jailer, stepped from behind the trunk of a
tree into the path.</p>
<p>"Well, Robie, how's the little girl?" said
Master Joseph.</p>
<p>"Bonnie as could be expected," was the
answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg
143]</a></span></p>
<p>"She sends word to you, sir," addressing
Master Raymond, "that you had better not come to see her. She knows
well all you could say&mdash;just as well as if she heard it, the
brave, bonnie lassie!"</p>
<p>"I know it," replied Master Raymond. "Tell
her I think of her every moment&mdash;and that things look
bright."</p>
<p>"Let us get out of this glooming, and where
we can see a rod around us," suggested the jailer. "I like to see
at least as far as my elbow, when I am talking
confidentially."</p>
<p>"I will go&mdash;you stay here with the
horses," said Raymond to Master Putnam. "I do not want you mixed up
with this thing any more than is absolutely necessary."</p>
<p>"Oh, I do not care for the risk&mdash;I like
it," replied his friend.</p>
<p>"Stay, nevertheless," insisted Master
Raymond. And getting down from his horse, and handing the bridle
rein to Master Putnam, he followed the jailer out into an open
space, where the rocks coming to the surface, had prevented the
growth of the forest. Here it was a little lighter than it had been
in the wood-path; but, the clouds having gathered over the sky
since they started, it was not possible to see very far around
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg
144]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hold up there!" cried Robie, catching
Raymond by the arm&mdash;"why, man, do you mean to walk straight
over the cliff?"</p>
<p>"I did not know any chasm was there," said
Raymond. "I never saw this place before. Master Putnam said it was
a spot where we should not be likely to be molested. And it does
look desolate enough." He leaned back against one of two upright
planks which seemed to have been placed there for some purpose, and
looked at a little pile of dirt and stones not far from his
feet.</p>
<p>"No," said the jailer. "I opine we shall not
be disturbed here. I do not believe there is more than three
persons in Salem that would be willing to come to this hill at this
time of day,&mdash;and they are here already." And the jailer
smiled audibly.</p>
<p>"Why, how is that?"</p>
<p>"Because they are all so damnably
sooperstitious!" replied Robie, with an air of vast
superiority.</p>
<p>"Ah! is this place then said to be
haunted?"</p>
<p>"Yes,&mdash;poor Goodwife Bishop's speerit is
said to haunt it. But as she never did anybody any harm while she
was living, I see not why she should harm any one now that she is
dead."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg
145]</a></span></p>
<p>"And so brave Bridget was executed near this
place? Where was the foul murder done?"</p>
<p>"You are leaning against the gallows," said
Robie quietly. "And that pile of stones at your feet is over her
grave."</p>
<p>Raymond was a brave man, physically and
morally, and not at all superstitious; but he recoiled
involuntarily from the plank against which he had been leaning, and
no longer allowed his right foot to rest upon the top stones of the
little heap that marked the grave.</p>
<p>"Oh, I thought you knew it," said the jailer
calmly. "I say, let them fear goodwife Bishop's ghost who did her
wrong. As for me, I favored her all I dared; and her last word to
me was a blessing. But now for your honor's business, I have not
long to stay."</p>
<p>"I have planned all but the getting out of
jail. Can it be easily done?"</p>
<p>"As easy as walking out of a
room."</p>
<p>"Will you not be suspected?"</p>
<p>"Not at all, I think&mdash;they are so
mightily sooperstitious. I shall lock everything tight after her;
and make up a good story about my wakening up in the middle of the
night, just in time to see her flying out of the top o' the house,
on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg
146]</a></span> black mare, and thrashing the animal with a
broom-handle. The bigger the lie the quicker they will believe
it."</p>
<p>"If they should suspect you, let Master
Putnam know, and he will get you off, if wit and money together can
do it."</p>
<p>"Oh, I believe that," said the jailer.
"Master Putnam is well known in all these parts, as a man that
never deserts a friend; and I'll warrant you are one of the same
grit."</p>
<p>"My hand on it, Robie!" and he shook the
jailer's hand warmly. "I shall never forget this
service."</p>
<p>"I am a rough, ignorant man," replied Robie
quietly; "but I know gentle blood when I see it."</p>
<p>"What time of night will suit you
best?"</p>
<p>"Just about twelve o'clock at night. That is
the time all the ghosts and goblins and weetches choose; and when
all honest people are in their beds, and in their first and
soundest sleep."</p>
<p>"We shall not be able to give you much
warning, for we must wait a favorable wind and tide."</p>
<p>"So you let me know by nightfall, it will
do."</p>
<p>"And now for the last point&mdash;what do I
pay you? I know we are asking you to run a great risk. The men that
whip gentlewomen, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147"
id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> cart's tail, and put little
children into jail, and sell them as slaves, will not spare you, if
they find out what you have done. Thank God, I am rich enough to
pay you well for taking such a fearful risk and shall be only too
glad to reward your unselfish deed."</p>
<p>"Not a shilling!" replied Robie proudly. "I
am not doing this thing for pay. It is for the old Captain's little
girl, that I have held in these arms many a day&mdash;and for the
old Captain himself. While these bloody landsmen," continued the
old sailor, "plague and persecute each other, Master Raymond, what
is that to us, we men of the sea, who have a creed and a belief of
our own, and who never even think of hurting a woman or a child?
But as for these landsmen, sticking at home all the time, how can
they be expected to know anything&mdash;compared to men that have
doubled both Capes, and seen people living all sorts of ways, and
believing all sorts of things? No, no," and Robie laughed
disdainfully, "let these land-lubbers attend to their own affairs;
but let them keep their hands off us seamen and our
families."</p>
<p>"So be it then, Robie; I honor your feelings!
But nevertheless I shall not forget you. And one<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> of
these days, if we get off safely, you shall hear from me again
about this matter."</p>
<p>And then, their plans settled, Robie trudged
down to the town; while the young men rode back the way they had
come, to Master Putnam's.</p>

<h4>The Reverend Master Parris Exorcises "Little
Witch."</h4>
<p>It will be remembered that Squire Hathorne
had directed that Dulcibel's little horse should be handed over to
the Reverend Master Parris, in order that it might be brought into
due subjection.</p>
<p>This had pleased Master Parris very much. In
the first place he was of a decidedly acquisitive turn&mdash;as had
been shown in his scheming to obtain a gift of the minister's house
and orchard&mdash;and moreover, if he was able to cast out the
devil that evidently possessed this horse, and make it a sober and
docile riding animal, it would not only be the gain of a very
pretty beast, but would prove that something of the power of
casting out devils, which had been given to the disciples of old,
had come down unto him. In such a case, his fame probably would
equal, if not surpass, that of the great Boston ministers, Increase
and Cotton Mather.</p>
<p>Goodman Buckley had brought down the little
mare, the next morning after the examination. The mare would lead
very well, if the person lead<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>ing her was on
horseback&mdash;very badly, if he were not, except under peculiar
circumstances. She was safely housed in the minister's stable, and
gazed at with mingled fear and admiration by the family and their
immediate neighbors. Master Parris liked horses, had some knowledge
of the right way to handle them, and showed more wisdom in his
treatment of this rather perverse animal of Dulcibel's than he had
ever manifested in his church difficulties.</p>
<p>He began by what he called a course of
conciliation&mdash;to placate the devil, as it were. How he could
bring his conscience to allow of this, I am not able to understand.
But then the mare, if the devil were once cast out, would be, on
account of her rare beauty, a very valuable animal. And so the
minister, twice a day, made a point of going into the little
passage, at the head of the stall, speaking kindly to the animal,
and giving her a small lump of maple sugar.</p>
<p>Like most of her sex, Susannah&mdash;as
Master Parris had renamed her, knowing the great importance of a
good name&mdash;was very fond of sugar; and her first apparent
aversion to the minister seemed gradually to change into a kind of
tacit respect and toleration, under the influence<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> of
his daily medications. Finally, the wary animal would allow him to
pat her neck without striking at him with one of her front feet, or
trying to bite him; and even to stroke her glossy flanks without
lunging at him with her hind heels, in an exceedingly dangerous
fashion.</p>
<p>But spiritual means also were not neglected.
The meeting-house was very near, and the mare was brought over
regularly when there were religious services, and fastened in the
near vicinity of the other more sober and orthodox horses, that she
might learn how to behave and perhaps the evil spirit be thus
induced to abandon one so constantly exposed to the doubtless
unpleasant sounds (to it) of psalm and prayer and
sermon.</p>
<p>A horse is an imitative animal, and very
susceptible to impressions,&mdash;both of a material and a mental
character&mdash;and I must confess that these proceedings of the
minister's were very well adapted to the object he had in
view.</p>
<p>The minister also had gone farther&mdash;but
of this no one at the time knew but himself. He had gone into the
stable on a certain evening, when his servant John Indian was off
on an errand; and had pronounced a prayer over the possessed animal
winding up with an exorcism which ought to have<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> been
sufficient to banish any reasonable devil, not only from the mare,
but from the neighborhood. As he concluded, what seemed to be a
huge creature, with outstretched wings, had buffeted him over the
ears, and then disappeared through the open window of the stable.
The creature was in the form of a big bat; but then it was well
known that this was one of the forms which evil spirits were most
fond of assuming.</p>
<p>The minister therefore had strong reasons for
supposing that the good work was now accomplished; and that he
should find the mare hereafter a Susannah not only in name but in
nature&mdash;a black lily, as it were. But of course this could not
be certainly told, unless some one should attempt to ride her; and
he suggested it one day to John Indian. But John
Indian&mdash;unknown to anybody but himself&mdash;had already tried
the experiment; and after a fierce contest, was satisfied with his
share of the glory. His answer was:&mdash;</p>
<p>"No, no, master&mdash;debbil hab no 'spect
for Indian man. Master he good man! gospel man! debbil 'fraid of
him&mdash;him too much for debbil!"</p>
<p>This seemed very reasonable for a poor,
untutored Indian. Mistress Parris, too, said that she<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> was
certain he could succeed if any one could. The evil spirits would
be careful how they conducted themselves towards such a highly
respected and godly minister as her revered husband. Several of her
acquaintances, pious and orthodox goodwives of the village, said
the same thing. Master Parris thought he was a very good horseman
besides; and began to take the same view. There was the horse, and
he was the man!</p>
<p>So one afternoon John Indian saddled and
bridled the mare, and brought her up to the horse-block. Susannah
had allowed herself to be saddled without the slightest
manifestation of ill-humor; probably the idea of stretching her
limbs a little, was decidedly pleasant in view of the small amount
of exercise she had taken lately.</p>
<p>But the wisest plan was not thought of. The
minister's niece, Abigail Williams&mdash;one of the
"afflicted"&mdash;had looked upon the black mare with longing eyes;
and if she had made the experiment, it probably would have been
successful. But they did not surmise that it might be the man's
saddle and mode of riding, to which the animal was entirely
unaccustomed, that were at the bottom of the difficulty. And,
besides, Master Parris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id=
"Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> wanted the mare for his own riding,
not for the women folks of his household.</p>
<p>Detained by various matters, it was not until
quite late in the afternoon, that the minister found time to try
the experiment of riding the now unbewitched animal. It was getting
too near night to ride very far, but he could at least try a short
ride of a mile or so; which perhaps would be better for the first
attempt than a longer one. So he came out to the horse-block,
attended by his wife and Abigail Williams, and a couple of
parishioners who had been holding a consultation with him, but had
stopped a moment to see him ride off upon the animal of which so
many marvelous stories had been told.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the minister, as he came out to
the horse-block, in answer to a remark made by one of his visitors,
"I think I have been able with the Lord's help, to redeem this
animal and make her a useful member of society. You will observe
that she now manifests none of that viciousness for which formerly
she was so noted."</p>
<p>The mare did stand as composedly and
peacefully as the most dignified minister could desire.</p>
<p>"You will remember that she has never been
ridden by any one, man or woman, save her witch<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
mistress Dulcibel&mdash;Jezebel, I think would be a more fitting
name for her, considering her wicked doings."</p>
<p>Here Master Parris took the bridle rein from
John Indian and threw his right leg over the animal. As the foot
and leg came down on that side, and the stirrup gave her a smart
crack, the mare's ears, which had been pricked up, went backwards
and she began to prance around, John Indian still holding her by
the mouth.</p>
<p>"Let her go, John," said the minister; "she
does not like to be held," and he tightened the rein.</p>
<p>John, by his master's orders, had put on a
curbbit; in place of the easy snaffle to which the mare had always
been accustomed. And now as the minister tightened the rein, and
the chain of the curb began to press upon and pain the mouth of the
sensitive creature, she began to back and rear in a most excited
fashion.</p>
<p>"Loose de rein!" cried John
Indian.</p>
<p>The minister did so. But the animal now was
fully alarmed; and no loosening or tightening would avail much. She
was her old self again&mdash;as bewitched as ever. She reared, she
plunged, she kicked, she sidled, and went through all the motions,
which, on previous occasions, she had<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> always found
eventually successful in ridding her back of its undesired
burden.</p>
<p>"Oh, do get off of the wild beast," cried
Mistress Parris, in great alarm.</p>
<p>"She is still bewitched," cried Abigail
Williams. "I see a spectre now, tormenting her with a
pitchfork."</p>
<p>"Oh, Samuel, you will be killed!&mdash;do get
off that crazy beast!" again cried weeping Mistress
Parris.</p>
<p>"'Get off!' yes!" thought the minister; "but
how am I going to do it, with the beast plunging and tearing in
this fashion?" The animal evidently wanted him off, and he was very
anxious to get off; but she would not hold still long enough for
him to dismount peaceably.</p>
<p>"Hold her while I dismount!" he cried to John
Indian. But when John Indian came near to take hold of the rein by
her mouth, the mare snapped at him viciously with her teeth; and
then wheeled around and flung out her heels at his head, in the
most embarrassing manner.</p>
<p>Finally, as with a new idea, the mare started
down the lane at a quick gallop, turned to the left, where a
rivulet had been damned up into a little pond not more than two
feet deep, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id=
"Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> plunged into the water, splashing it
up around her like a many jetted fountain.</p>
<p>By this time, the minister, being only human,
naturally was very angry; and commenced lashing her sides with his
riding whip to get her into the lane again. This made the fiery
little creature perfectly desperate, and she reared up and
backwards, until she came down plump into the water; so that, if
the saddle girth had not broken, and the saddle come off, and the
minister with it, she might have tumbled upon him and perhaps
seriously hurt him. But, as it was, no great damage was done; and
the bridle also breaking, the mare spit the bit out of her mouth,
and went down the lane in a run to the road, and thence on into the
now fast-gathering night, no one could see whither.</p>
<p>Mistress Parris, John Indian and the rest
were by this time at the side of the pond, and ready to receive the
chapfallen minister as he emerged with the saddle and the broken
bridle from the water.</p>
<p>"You are a sight, Samuel Parris!" said his
wife, in that pleasant tone with which many wives are apt to
receive their liege lords upon such unpleasant occasions. "Do get
into the house at once. You will catch your death of cold, I
know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg
158]</a></span> And such a mess your clothes will be! But I only
wonder you are not killed&mdash;trying to ride a mad witch's horse
like that is."</p>
<p>The minister made no reply. The situation
transcended words. And did not allow even of sympathy, as his
visitors evidently thought&mdash;not at least until he got on some
clean and dry clothes. So they simply shook their heads, and took
their course homewards. While the bedraggled and dripping Master
Parris made his way to the house wiping the water and mud from his
face with his wife's handkerchief, and stopping to shake himself
well, before he entered the door, lest, as his wife said, "he
should spoil everything in his chamber."</p>
<p>Abigail Williams, when she went to see
Mistress Ann Putnam that night, had a marvelous tale to tell; which
in the course of the next day, went like wildfire through the
village, growing still more and more marvelous as it
went.</p>
<p>Abigail had seen, as I have already said, the
spectre of a witch goading the furious animal with a pitchfork.
When the horse tore down the lane, it came to the little brook and
of course could not cross it&mdash;for a witch cannot cross running
water. Therefore, in its new access of fury, it sprang
into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg
159]</a></span> the pond&mdash;and threw off the minister. Abigail
further declared that then, dashing down the lane it came to the
gate which shut it off from the road, and took the gate in a flying
leap. But the animal never came down again. It was getting quite
dark then, but she could still plainly see that a witch was upon
its back, belaboring it with a broomstick. And she knew very well
who that witch was. It was the "spectre" of Dulcibel
Burton&mdash;for it had a scarlet bodice on, just such as Dulcibel
nearly always wore. They two&mdash;the mare and its
rider&mdash;went off sailing up into the sky, and disappeared
behind a black cloud. And Abigail was almost certain that just as
they reached the cloud, there was a low rumbling like
thunder.</p>
<p>It was noticeable that every time Abigail
told this story, she remembered something that she had not before
thought of; until in the course of a week or two, there were very
few stories in the "Arabian Nights" that could surpass it in
marvelousness.</p>
<p>As the mare had not returned to her old
stable at Goodman Buckley's, and could not be heard of in any other
direction, Abigail's story began to commend itself even to the
older and cooler heads of the village. For if the elfish creature
had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg
160]</a></span> vanished in the black cloud, to the sound of
thunder, where was she?</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam, and his household however held
a different view of the subject, but they wisely kept their own
counsel; though they had many a sly joke among themselves at the
credulity of their neighbors. They knew that a little while after
dark, a strange noise had been heard at the barn, and that one of
the hired men going out, had found Dulcibel's horse, without saddle
or bridle, pawing at the door of the stable for admission. As this
was a place the animal had been in the habit of coming to, and
where she was always well treated and even petted, it was very
natural that she should fly here from her persecutors, as she
doubtless considered them.</p>
<p>Upon being told of it, and not knowing what
had occurred Master Joseph thought it most prudent not to put the
animal into his stable, but ordered the man to get half-a-peck of
oats, and some hay, and take the mare to a small cow-pen, in the
woods in an out of the way place, where she might be for years, and
no one outside his own people be any the wiser for it. The mare
seemed quite docile, and was easily led, being in company with the
oats, of which a handful occasionally was given to her;<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> and
so, being watered at a stream near by and fed daily, she was no
doubt far more comfortable than she would have been in the black
cloud that Abigail Williams was perfectly ready to swear she had
seen her enter and where though there might be plenty of water,
oats doubtless were not often meet with.</p>

<h4>Master Raymond Also Complains of an "Evil
Hand."</h4>
<p>Master Raymond had everything now prepared
upon his part, and was awaiting a message from Captain Alden, to
the effect that he had made a positive engagement with the Danish
captain.</p>
<p>He had caught a serious cold on his return
from Boston and, turning the matter over in his mind&mdash;for it
is a wise thing to try to get some good result out of even
apparently evil occurrences&mdash;he had called in the village
doctor.</p>
<p>But the good Doctor's medicine did not seem
to work as it ought to&mdash;for one reason, Master Raymond
regularly emptied the doses out of the window; thinking as he told
Master Joseph, to put them where they would do the most good. And
when the Doctor came, and found that neither purging nor vomiting
had been produced, these with bleeding and sweating being the great
panaceas of that day&mdash;as perhaps of this&mdash;he was
naturally astonished. In a case where neither castor oil, senna and
manna, nor large doses of Glauber's salts would work, a medical man
was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg
163]</a></span> certainly justified in thinking that something must
be wrong.</p>
<p>Master Raymond suggested whether "an evil
hand" might not be upon him. This was the common explanation at
that time in Salem and its neighborhood. The doctors and the
druggists nowadays miss a great deal in not having such an excuse
made ready to their hands&mdash;it would account alike for
adulterated drugs and ill-judged remedies.</p>
<p>Master Raymond had the reputation of being
rich, and the Doctor had been mortified by the bad behavior of his
medicines&mdash;for if a patient be not cured, if he is at least
vigorously handled, there seems to be something that can with
propriety be heavily charged for. But if a doctor does
nothing&mdash;neither cures, nor anything else&mdash;with what face
can he bring in a weighty bill?</p>
<p>And so good Doctor Griggs readily acquiesced
in his patient's supposition that "an evil hand," was at work, and
even suggested that he should bring Abigail Williams or some other
"afflicted" girl with him the next time he came, to see with her
sharpened eyes who it was that was bewitching him.</p>
<p>But Master Raymond declined the
offer&mdash;at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id=
"Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> least for the present. If the thing
continued, and grew worse, he might be able himself to see who it
was. Why should he not be as able to do it as Abigail Williams, or
any other of the "afflicted" circle? Of course the doctor was not
able to answer why; there seemed to be no good reason why one set
of "afflicted" people should have a monopoly of the accusing
business.</p>
<p>Of course this came very quickly from the
Doctor to Mistress Ann Putnam&mdash;for he was a regular attendant
of that lady, whose nervous system indeed was in a fearful state by
this time. And she puzzled a good deal over it. Did Master Raymond
intend to accuse anyone? Who was it? Or was it merely a hint thrown
out, that it was a game that two parties could play at?</p>
<p>But then she smiled&mdash;she had the two
ministers, and through them all the other ministers of the
colony&mdash;the magistrates and judges&mdash;and the advantages of
the original position. Imitators always failed. Still she rather
liked the young man's craft and boldness&mdash;Joseph Putnam would
never have thought of such a thing. But still let him beware how he
attempted to thwart her plans. He would soon find that she was the
stronger.</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam then began to answer
inquiries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg
165]</a></span> as to the health of his guest,&mdash;that he was
not much better, and thought somewhat of going up to Boston for
further medical advice&mdash;as the medicines given him so far did
not seem to work as well as they should do.</p>
<p>"Could he bear the ride?"</p>
<p>"Oh, very well indeed&mdash;his illness had
not so far affected his strength much."</p>

<h4>Master Raymond's Little Plan
Blocked.</h4>
<p>"Our game is blocked!" said Joseph Putnam to
Master Raymond as he rode up one afternoon soon after, and
dismounted at the garden gate, where his guest was awaiting him,
impatient to hear if anything had yet come from Captain
Alden.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" said his
guest.</p>
<p>"Mean? Why, that yon she-wolf is too much for
us. Captain Alden is arrested!"</p>
<p>"What! Captain John Alden!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain John Alden!"</p>
<p>"On what charge?"</p>
<p>Master Joseph smiled grimly, "For
witchcraft!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>
<p>"Yes, devilish nonsense! but true as gospel,
nevertheless."</p>
<p>"And he submits to it?"</p>
<p>"With all around him crazy, he cannot help
it. Besides, as an officer of the government, he must submit to the
laws."</p>
<p>"On whose complaint?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the she-wolf's of course&mdash;that
delectable smooth-spoken wife of my brother Thomas. How<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> any
man can love a catty creature like that, beats me out."</p>
<p>"I suppose she found out that I went
frequently to see the Captain, when in Boston?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so."</p>
<p>"Who could have informed her?"</p>
<p>"Her master, the devil, I
suppose."</p>
<p>"Where is the Captain to be
examined?"</p>
<p>"Oh, here in Salem, where his accusers are.
It comes off tomorrow. They lose no time you see."</p>
<p>"Well, I would not have believed it possible.
Whom will they attack next?"</p>
<p>"The Governor, I suppose," replied Master
Joseph satirically.</p>
<p>"Or you?"</p>
<p>"If she does, I'll run my sword through
her&mdash;not as being a woman, but as a foul fiend. I told her so.
Let her dare to touch me, or any one under this roof!"</p>
<p>"What did she say when you threatened
her?"</p>
<p>"She put on an injured expression; and said
she could never believe anything wrong of her dear husband's
family, if all the 'spectres' in the world told her so."</p>
<p>"Well, I hope you are safe, but as for
me&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id=
"Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, you are, too. You are within my gates.
To touch you, is to touch me. She fully realizes that. Besides
brother Thomas is her abject tool in most things; but some things
even he would not allow."</p>
<p>Yes, Captain John Alden, son of that John
Alden who was told by the pretty Puritan maiden, "Speak for
yourself John," when he went pleading the love-suit of his friend
Captain Miles Standish; John Alden, captain of the only vessel of
war belonging to the colony, a man of large property, and occupying
a place in the very front rank of Boston society, had been arrested
for witchcraft! What a state of insanity the religious delusion had
reached, can be seen by this high-handed proceeding.</p>
<p>Here again we come on to ground in which the
details given in the old manuscript book, are fully confirmed, in
every essential particular by existing public records. Mr. Upham,
whose admirable account of "Salem Witchcraft" has been of great aid
to me in the preparation of this volume, is evidently puzzled to
account for Captain Alden's arrest. He is not able to see how the
gallant Captain could have excited the ire of the "afflicted
circle." He seems to have been entirely ignorant<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> of
this case of Dulcibel Burton&mdash;hers doubtless being one of the
many cases in which the official records were purposely destroyed.
If he had known of this case, he would have seen the connection
between it and Captain Alden. It also might have explained the
continual allusions to the "yellow bird" in so many of the
trials&mdash;based possibly on Dulcibel's canary, which had been
given to her by the Captain, and whose habit of kissing her lips
with its little bill had appeared so mysterious and diabolical to
the superstitious inhabitants of Salem village.</p>
<p>Master Raymond's health, as is not to be
wondered at, had improved sufficiently by the next day, to allow of
his accompanying Joseph Putnam to the village, to attend Captain
Alden's examination. The meeting-house was even more crowded than
usual, such was the absorbing interest taken in the case, owing to
the Captain's high standing in the province.</p>
<p>The veteran Captain's own brief account of
this matter, which has come down to us, does not go into many
details, and is valuable mainly as showing that he regarded it very
much in the same light that it is regarded now&mdash;owing probably
to the fact that while a church member in good<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
standing, he doubtless was a good deal better seaman than church
member. For he says he was "sent for by the Magistrates of Salem,
upon the accusation of a company of poor distracted or possessed
creatures or witches." And he speaks further of them as "wenches
who played their juggling tricks, falling down, crying out, and
staring in people's faces."</p>
<p>The worthy Captain's account is however, as I
have said, very brief&mdash;and has the tone of one who had been a
participant, however unwillingly, in a grossly shameful affair,
alike disgraceful to the colony and to everybody concerned in it.
For some additional details, I am indebted to the manuscript
volume.</p>
<p>Captain Alden had not been arrested in
Boston. He says himself in his statement, that "he was sent to
Salem by Mr. Stoughton"&mdash;the Deputy Governor, and
Chief-Justice of the Special Court that had condemned and executed
Bridget Bishop, and which was now about to meet again.</p>
<p>Before the meeting of the magistrates, Master
Raymond had managed to have a few words with him in private, and
found that no arrangements with any skipper had yet been made. The
first negotiations had fallen through, and there was no<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
other foreign vessel at that time in port whose master possessed
what Captain Alden considered the requisite trustworthiness and
daring. For he wanted a skipper that would show fight if he was
pursued and overtaken; not that any actual fighting would probably
be necessary, for a simple show of resistance would doubtless be
all that was needed.</p>
<p>"When I get back to Boston, I think I shall
be able to arrange matters in the course of a week or
two."</p>
<p>"What&mdash;in Boston jail?" queried Master
Raymond.</p>
<p>"You do not suppose the magistrates will
commit me on such a trumped-up nonsensical charge as this?" said
the stout old captain indignantly.</p>
<p>"Indeed I do," was the reply.</p>
<p>"Why, there is not a particle of truth in it.
I never saw these girls. I never even heard of their being in
existence."</p>
<p>"Oh, that makes no difference."</p>
<p>"The devil it doesn't!" said the old man,
hotly. My readers must remember that he was a seaman.</p>
<p>Here the sheriff came up and told the Captain
he was wanted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id=

<h4>Captain Alden before the
Magistrates.</h4>
<p>There was an additional magistrate sitting on
this occasion, Master Bartholomew Gedney&mdash;making three in
all.</p>
<p>Mistress Ann Putnam, the she-wolf, as her
young brother-in-law had called her, was not present among the
accusers&mdash;leaving the part of the "afflicted" to be played by
the other and younger members of the circle.</p>
<p>There was another Captain present, also a
stranger, a Captain Hill; and he being also a tall man, perplexed
some of the girls at first. One even pointed at him, until she was
better informed in a whisper by a man who was holding her up. And
then she cried out that it was "Alden! Alden!" who was afflicting
her.</p>
<p>At length one of the magistrates ordering
Captain Alden to stand upon a chair, there was no further trouble
upon that point; and the usual demonstrations began. As the accused
naturally looked upon the "afflicted" girls, they went off into
spasms, shrieks and convulsions. This was nearly always the first
proceeding, as it created<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173"
id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> a profound sympathy for them, and
was almost sufficient of itself to condemn the accused.</p>
<p>"The tall man is pinching me!"</p>
<p>"Oh, he is choking me!"</p>
<p>"He is choking me! do hold his
hands!"</p>
<p>"He stabs me with his sword&mdash;oh, take it
away from him!"</p>
<p>Such were the exclamations that came from the
writhing and convulsed girls.</p>
<p>"Turn away his head! and hold his hands!"
cried Squire Hathorne. "Take away his sword!" said Squire Gedney
while the old Captain grew red and wrathful at the babel around
him, and at the indignities to which he was subject.</p>
<p>"Captain Alden, why do you torment these poor
girls who never injured you?"</p>
<p>"Torment them!&mdash;you see I am not
touching them. I do not even know them; I never saw them before in
my life," growled the indignant old seaman.</p>
<p>"See! there is the little yellow bird kissing
his lips!" cried Abigail Williams. "Now it is whispering into his
ear. It is bringing him a message from the other witch Dulcibel
Burton. See! see! there it goes back again to her&mdash;through the
window!"</p>
<p>So well was this done, that probably half of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg
174]</a></span> people present would have been willing to swear the
next day, that they actually saw the yellow bird as she described
it.</p>
<p>"Ask him if he did not give her the yellow
bird," said Leah Herrick. "But probably he will lie about
it."</p>
<p>"Did you not give the witch, Dulcibel Burton,
a yellow bird, which is one of her familiars?" said Squire Hathorne
sternly.</p>
<p>"I gave her a canary bird that I brought from
the West Indies, if that is what you mean," replied the Captain.
"But what harm was there in that?"</p>
<p>"I knew it! The yellow bird told me so, when
it came to peck out my eyes," cried Mercy Lewis. "Oh! there it is
again!" and she struck wildly into the air before her face. "Drive
it away! Do drive it away, some one!"</p>
<p>Here a young man pulled out his rapier, and
began thrusting at the invisible bird in a furious
manner.</p>
<p>"Now it comes to me!" cried Sarah Churchill.
And then the other girls also cried out, and began striking into
the air before their faces, till there was anew a perfect babel of
cries, shrieks and sympathizing voices.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg
175]</a></span></p>
<p>Master Raymond, amid all his indignation at
such barefaced and wicked and yet successful imposture, could
hardly avoid smiling at the expression of the old seaman's face as
he stood on the chair, and fronted all this tempest of absurd and
villainous accusation. At first there had been a deep crimson glow
of the hottest wrath upon the old man's cheeks and brow; but now he
seemed to have been shocked into a kind of stupor, so unexpected
and weighty were the charges against him, and made with such
vindictive fierceness; and yet so utterly absurd, while at the same
time, so impossible of being refuted.</p>
<p>"He bought the yellow bird from Tituba's
mother&mdash;her spectre told me so!" cried Abigail
Williams.</p>
<p>"What do you say to that, Master Alden?" said
Squire Gedney. "That is a serious charge."</p>
<p>"I never saw any Tituba or her mother,"
exclaimed the Captain, again growing indignant.</p>
<p>"Who then did you buy the witch's familiar
of?" asked Squire Hathorne.</p>
<p>"I do not know&mdash;some old negro
wench!"</p>
<p>Here the magistrates looked at each other
sagely, and nodded their wooden heads. It was a fatal admission.
"You had better confess all,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> and give glory to
God!" said Squire Gedney solemnly.</p>
<p>"I trust I shall always be ready to give
glory to God," answered the old man stoutly; "but I do not see that
it would glorify Him to confess to a pack of lies. You have known
me for many years, Master Gedney, but did you ever know me to speak
an untruth, or seek to injure any innocent persons, much less women
and children?"</p>
<p>Squire Gedney said that he had known the
accused many years, and had even been at sea with him, and had
always supposed him to be an honest man; but now he saw good cause
to alter that judgment.</p>
<p>"Turn and look now again upon those afflicted
persons," concluded Squire Gedney.</p>
<p>As the accused turned and again looked upon
them, all of the "afflicted" fell down on the floor as if he had
struck them a heavy blow&mdash;moaning and crying out against
him.</p>
<p>"I judge you by your works; and believe you
now to be a wicked man and a witch," said Squire Gedney in a very
severe tone.</p>
<p>Captain Alden turned then and looked directly
at the magistrate for several moments. "Why does not my look knock
you down too?" he said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id=
"Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> indignantly. "If it hurts them so
much, would it not hurt you a little?"</p>
<p>"He wills it not to hurt you," cried Leah
Herrick. "He is looking at you, but his spectre has its back
towards you."</p>
<p>There was quite a roar of applause through
the crowded house at such an exposure of the old Captain's
trickery. He was very cunning to be sure; but the "afflicted" girls
could see through his knavery.</p>
<p>"Make him touch the poor girls," said the
Reverend Master Noyes. For it was the accepted theory that by doing
this, the witch, in spite of himself, reabsorbed into his own body
the devilish energy that had gone out of him, and the afflicted
were healed. This was repeatedly done through the progress of these
examinations and the after trials; and was always found to be
successful, both as a cure of the sufferers, and an undeniable
proof that the person accused was really a witch.</p>
<p>In this case the "afflicted" girls were
brought up to Captain Alden, one after the other and upon his being
made to touch them with his hand, they invariably drew a deep
breath of relief, and said they felt entirely well
again.</p>
<p>"You see Captain Alden," said Squire
Gedney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg
178]</a></span> solemnly, "none of the tests fail in your case. If
there were only one proof, we might doubt; but as the Scripture
says, by the mouths of two or three witnesses shall the truth be
established. If you were innocent a just God would not allow you to
be overcome in this manner."</p>
<p>"I know that there is a just God, and I know
that I am entirely innocent" replied the noble old seaman in a firm
voice. "But it is not for an uninspired man like me, to attempt to
reconcile the mysteries of His providence. Far better men than I
am, even prophets and apostles, have been brought before
magistrates and judges, and their good names lied away, and they
condemned to the prison and the scaffold and the cross. Why then,
should I expect to fare better than they did? All I can do, like
Job of old, is to maintain my integrity&mdash;even though Satan and
all his imps be let loose for a time against me."</p>
<p>Here the Reverend Master Noyes rose
excitedly, and said that the decisions of heathen courts and judges
were one thing; and the decisions of godly magistrates, who were
all members of the church of the true God, and therefore inspired
by his spirit, was a very different thing. He said it was simply
but another proof of the guilt of the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> accused, that he
should compare himself with the apostles and the martyrs; and these
worshipful Christian magistrates with heathen magistrates and
judges. Hearing him talk in this ribald way, he could no longer
doubt the accusation brought against him; for there was no surer
proof of a man or woman having dealings with Satan, than to defame
and calumniate God's chosen people.</p>
<p>As Mr. Noyes took his seat, the magistrates
said they had heard sufficient, and ordered the committal of the
accused to Boston prison to await trial.</p>
<p>"I will give bail for Captain Alden's
appearance, to the whole amount of my estate," said Joseph Putnam
coming forward. "A man of his age, who has served the colony in so
many important positions, should be treated with some
leniency."</p>
<p>"We are very sorry for the Captain," answered
Squire Gedney, "but as this is a capital offence, no bail can be
taken."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Master Putnam, but I want no
bail," said the old seaman proudly. "If the colony of Massachusetts
Bay, which my father helped to build up, and for which I have
labored so long and faithfully, chooses to requite my services in
this ungrateful fashion, let it be so. The shame is on
Massachusetts not on me!"</p>

<h4>Considering New Plans.</h4>
<p>"Well, what now?" said Master Joseph Putnam
to his guest, as they rode homeward. "You might give up the
sea-route and try a push through the wilderness to the Hudson
River."</p>
<p>"Rather dangerous that."</p>
<p>"Yes, unless you could secure the services of
some heathen savages to pilot you through."</p>
<p>"Could we trust them?"</p>
<p>"Twenty years ago, according to my father's
old stories, we could; but they are very bitter now&mdash;they do
not keep much faith with white men.</p>
<p>"Perhaps the white men have not kept much
faith with them."</p>
<p>"Of course not. You know they are the
heathen; and we have a Bible communion to exterminate them, and
drive them out of our promised land."</p>
<p>"Do you believe that?"</p>
<p>"Well, not exactly," and Master Joseph
laughed. "Besides, I think the Quaker plan both cheaper in the end
and a great deal safer. Not that I believe they have any more right
to the land than we have."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181"
id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>"Penn and the Quakers think
differently."</p>
<p>"I know they do&mdash;but they are a set of
crazy enthusiasts."</p>
<p>"What is your view? That of your ministers?
The earth is the Lord's. He has given it to His saints. We are the
saints."</p>
<p>Master Joseph laughed again. "Well, something
like that. The earth is the Lord's. He has intended it for the use
of His children. We are His children quite as much as the savages.
Therefore we have as much right to it as they have."</p>
<p>"Only they happen to be in possession,"
replied Master Raymond, drily.</p>
<p>"Are they in possession? So far as they are
actually in possession, I admit their right. But do you seriously
mean that a few hundred or thousand of wild heathen, have a right
to prior occupancy to the whole North American continent? It seems
to me absurd?"</p>
<p>"A relative of mine has ten square miles in
Scotland that he never occupies, in your sense of the word any more
than your red-men do; and yet he is held to have a valid right to
it, against the hundreds of peasants who would like to enter in and
take possession."</p>
<p>"Oh, plenty of things are done wrong in the
old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg
182]</a></span> world," replied Master Putnam; "that is why we
Puritans are over here. But still the fact remains that the earth
is the Lord's and that He intended it for His children's use; and
no merely legal or personal right can be above that. If ever the
time comes that your relative's land is really needed by the people
at large, why then some way will have to be contrived to get hold
of it for them."</p>
<p>"The Putnam family have a good many broad
acres too," said Master Raymond, with a smile, looking around
him.</p>
<p>"Oh, you cannot scare me," replied his
friend, also smiling. "What is sauce for the Campbell goose is
sauce for the Putnam gander. If the time ever comes when the public
good requires that the broad lands of the Putnams&mdash;if there be
any Putnams at that time&mdash;have to be appropriated to meet the
wants of their fellow men, then the broad Putnam lands will have to
go like the rest, I imagine. We have taken them from the Indians,
just as the Normans took them from the Saxons&mdash;and as the
Saxons took them from the Danes and the ancient
inhabitants&mdash;by the strong hand. But the sword can give no
right&mdash;save as the claim of the public good is behind it. Show
me that the public good requires it, and I am will<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>ing
that the title-deeds for my own share of the broad Putnam lands
shall be burnt up tomorrow."</p>
<p>"I believe you, my dear friend," said Master
Raymond, gazing with admiration upon the manly, glowing face of
this nature's nobleman. "And I am inclined to think that your whole
view of the matter is correct. But, coming back to our first point,
do you know of any savage that we could trust to guide us safely to
the settlements on the Hudson?"</p>
<p>"If old king Philip, whose head has been
savagely exposed to all weathers on the gibbet at Plymouth for the
last sixteen years, were alive, something perhaps might be done.
His safeguard would have carried you through."</p>
<p>"Is there not another chief, called
Nucas?"</p>
<p>"Oh, old Nucas, of the Mohegans. He was a
character! But he died ten years ago. Lassacus, too, was killed.
There are a couple of Pequod settlements down near New Haven I
believe; but they are too far off."</p>
<p>"And then you could not tell me where to put
my hand on some dozen or so of the Indians, whom I might engage as
a convoy."</p>
<p>"Not now. A roving party may pass in the
woods at any time. But they would not be very<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
reliable. If they could make more by selling your scalps than by
keeping them safely on your heads, they would be pretty sure to
sell them."</p>
<p>"Then I see nothing to do, but to go again to
Boston, and arrange another scheme on the old plan."</p>
<p>"You ought not to travel long in Dulcibel's
company without being married," said Master Putnam
bluntly.</p>
<p>"Very true&mdash;but we can not well be
married without giving our names to the minister; and to do that,
would be to deliver ourselves up to the authorities."</p>
<p>"Mistress Putnam and myself might accompany
you to New York&mdash;we should not mind a little trip."</p>
<p>"And thus make yourselves parties to
Dulcibel's escape? No, no, my good friend&mdash;that would be to
put you both in prison in her place."</p>
<p>"It is not likely there would be any other
woman on board the vessel&mdash;that is of any reputation. You must
try to get some one to go with you."</p>
<p>"And incur the certainty of punishment when
she returns?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps you could find some one who would
like to settle permanently in New York. I should<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> like
to go myself if I could, and get out of this den of wild
beasts."</p>
<p>"Yes, I may be able to do that&mdash;though I
shall not dare to try that until the last day almost&mdash;for the
women always have some man to consult, and thus our secret plan
would get blown about, to our great peril."</p>
<p>"I have a scheme!" cried Master Joseph in
exultation. "It is the very thing," and he burst out laughing.
"Kidnap Cotton Mather, or one of the other Boston ministers, and
take him with you."</p>
<p>"That would be a bold stroke," replied Master
Raymond, also laughing heartily. "But, like belling the cat, it is
easier said than done. Ministers are apt to be cautious and wary.
They are timid folk."</p>
<p>"Not when a wedding is to be solemnized, and
a purse of gold-pieces is shaken before them," returned Master
Putnam. "Have everything ready to sail. Then decoy the minister on
board, to marry a wealthy foreign gentleman, a friend of the
skipper's&mdash;and do not let him go again. Pay him enough and the
skipper will think it a first rate joke."</p>
<p>"But he might be so angry that he would
refuse to marry us after all our trouble."<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg
186]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, do not you believe that&mdash;if you
make the fee large enough. Treat him kindly, represent to him the
absolute necessity of the case, say that you never would have
thought of such a thing if it could in any way have been avoided,
and I'll warrant he will do the job before you reach New
York."</p>
<p>"I wish I felt as certain as you
do."</p>
<p>"Well, suppose he will not be mollified. What
then? Your end is attained. He has acted as chaperon, and
involuntary master of propriety whether he would or not. A minister
is just as good as a matron to chaperon the maiden. Of course he
will have his action for damages against you, and you will be
willing to pay him fairly, but if he brings you before a jury of
New Yorkers, and you simply relate the facts, and the necessity of
the case, little will he get of damages beyond a plentiful supply
of jokes and laughter. You know there is very little love lost
between the people of the two colonies; and that the Manhattan
people have no more respect for all the witchcraft business, than
you and I have."</p>
<p>Master Raymond made no reply. He did not want
to kidnap a minister, if it could be in any way avoided. With
Master Putnam, however, that<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> seemed to be one of
the most desirable features of the proposed plan, only he was
tenfold more sorry now than ever, that such weighty prudential
reasons prevented his taking any active share in the enterprise. To
kidnap a minister&mdash;especially if it could be the Reverend
Cotton Mather&mdash;seemed to him something which was worth almost
the risking of his liberty and property in which to take a
hand.</p>

<h4>The Dissimulation of Master
Raymond.</h4>
<p>About this time the gossips of Salem village
began to remark upon the attentions that were being paid by the
wealthy young Englishman, Master Ellis Raymond, to various members
of the "afflicted circle." He petted those bright and terribly
precocious children of twelve, Ann Putnam and Abigail Williams; he
almost courted the older girls, Mary Walcot, Mercy Lewis and Leah
Herrick and had a kindly word for Mary Warren, Sarah Churchill and
others, whenever he saw them. As for Mistress Ann Putnam, the
mother, he always had been very respectful to her. While in Boston
he had purchased quite an assortment of those little articles which
the Puritan elders usually denominated "gew-gaws" and "vain
adornments" and it was observed that Abigail Williams especially
had been given a number of these, while the other girls had one or
more of them, which they were very careful in not displaying except
at those times when no grave elder or deacon was present to be
shocked by them.</p>
<p>I will acknowledge that there was some
dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg
189]</a></span>simulation in this conduct of Master Raymond's, and
Joseph Putnam by no means approved of it.</p>
<p>"How you can go smiling around that den of
big and little she-wolves, patting the head of one, and playing
with the paw of another, I cannot understand, friend Raymond. I
would not do it to save my life."</p>
<p>"Nor I," answered Master Raymond gravely.
"But I would do it to save your life, friend Joseph, or that of
your sweet young wife there&mdash;or that of the baby which she
holds upon her knee."</p>
<p>"Or that of Mistress Dulcibel Burton!" added
sweet Mistress Putnam kindly.</p>
<p>"Yes, or that of Dulcibel Burton."</p>
<p>"You know, my dear friends, the plan I have
in view may fail. If that should fail, I am laying the foundation
of another&mdash;so that if Dulcibel should be brought to trial,
the witnesses that are relied upon may fail to testify so wantonly
against her. Even little Abigail Williams has the assurance and
ingenuity to save her, if she will."</p>
<p>"Yes, that precocious child is a very imp of
Satan," said Joseph Putnam. "What a terrible woman she will
make."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, she may sink down into a very tame
and commonplace woman, after this tremendous<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
excitement is over," rejoined his friend. "I think at times I see
symptoms of it now. The strain is too great for her childish
brain."</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose your dissimulation is
allowable if it is to save the life of your betrothed," said Master
Putnam, "but I would not do it if I could and I could not if I
would."</p>
<p>"Do you remember Junius Brutus playing
idiot&mdash;and King David playing imbecile?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know you have plenty of authority for
your dissimulation."</p>
<p>"It seems to me," joined in young Mistress
Putnam, "that the difference between you is simply this. Joseph
could not conscientiously do it; and you can."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is about the gist of it," said her
young husband. "And now that I have relieved my conscience by
protesting against your course, I am satisfied you should go on in
your own way just the same."</p>
<p>"And yet you feel no conscientious scruples
against abducting the minister," rejoined Raymond laughing; "a
thing which I am rather loath to do."</p>
<p>"I see," replied Joseph, also laughing. "I
scruple at taking mustard, and you at cayenne<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
pepper. It is a matter of mental organization probably."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;and if a few or many doses of
mustard will prevent my being arrested as a witch, which would put
it entirely out of my power to aid Dulcibel in her
affliction&mdash;and perhaps turn some of the "afflicted" girls
over to her side, in case she has to stand a trial for her
life&mdash;I shall certainly swallow them with as much grace as if
they were so many spoonfuls of honey. There is a time to be
over-scrupulous, friend Joseph, but not when my beloved one is in
the cage of the tigers. Yes, I shall not hesitate to meet craft
with craft."</p>
<p>And Mistress Putnam, sweet, good woman as she
was, nodded her head, woman-like, approvingly, carried away perhaps
by the young man's earnestness, and by the strength of his
love.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id=

<h4>The Cruel Doings of the Special
Court.</h4>
<p>Meanwhile the Special Court of seven
Judges&mdash;a majority of whom were from Boston, with the Deputy
Governor of the Colony, William Stoughten, as
Chief-Justice&mdash;was by no means indolent. Of the proceedings of
this court, which embodied apparently the best legal intellect of
the colony, no official record is in existence. Its shameful pages,
smeared all over with bigotry and blood, no doubt were purposely
destroyed. So far as we are acquainted with the evidence given
before it, it was substantially the same as had been given at the
previous examinations before the committing magistrates.</p>
<p>That nothing was too extravagant and absurd
to be received as evidence by this learned court, is proven by the
statement of the Reverend Cotton Mather, already alluded to,
relative to a demon entering the meeting-house and tearing down a
part of it, in obedience to a look from Mistress Bridget
Bishop&mdash;of which diabolical outrage the Court was duly
informed. Besides, there could have been no other kind of evidence
forthcoming,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id=
"Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> that would apply to the crime of
which all the accused were charged, Witchcraft. Many of the
prisoners indeed were accused of murdering children and others,
whose illness had been beyond the physician's power to cure; but
the murders were all committed, it was alleged, by the use of
"spectres," "familiars," "puppets," and other supernatural means.
Against such accusations it was impossible for men and women of the
highest character and reputation to make any effectual defence,
before a court and jury given over so completely to religious
fanaticism and superstitious fancies. To be accused was therefore
to be condemned.</p>
<p>Yes, this Special Court, having had all its
misgivings, if it ever really had any, quieted by the answer of the
council of ministers, was doing quick and fearful work.</p>
<p>Meeting again in the latter part of June, it
speedily tried, convicted and sentenced to death five
persons:&mdash;Sarah Good, Sarah Wildes, Elizabeth How, Susanna
Martin and Rebecca Nurse.</p>
<p>Then, adjourning till August 5th, it tried
and convicted George Burroughs, John Procter, Elizabeth Procter,
George Jacobs, John Willard and Martha Carrier.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg
194]</a></span></p>
<p>Then meeting on September 9th, it tried and
condemned Martha Corey, Mary Easty, Alice Parker and Ann Pudcator;
and on September 17th, Margaret Scott, Wilmot Reed, Samuel Wardwell
and Mary Parker.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that of the above nineteen
persons, only five were men. As the greater number of the accusers
were also of the female sex, it was natural, I suppose, that this
should be so. And thus we find that the word witch is applied
indifferently in the old records, to men and women; the masculine
term wizard being seldom used.</p>
<p>That the learned Judges were fully as
superstitious as the people at large, is conclusively proved by
certain facts that have come down to us. In the case of that lovely
and venerable matron, Rebecca Nurse, the jury at first brought in
the verdict "Not guilty."</p>
<p>But immediately all the accusers in the
Court, and all the "afflicted" out of it, made a hideous outcry.
Two of the Judges said they were not satisfied. The Chief-Justice
intimated that there was one admission of the prisoner that the
jury had not properly considered. These things induced the jurors
to go out again, and come back with a verdict of
"Guilty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg
195]</a></span></p>
<p>One of the charges against Rebecca Nurse,
testified to by Edward Putnam, was that, after the said Rebecca
Nurse had been committed to jail, and was thus several miles
distant in the town of Salem, "she, the said Nurse, struck Mistress
Ann Putnam with her spectral chain, leaving a mark, being a kind of
round ring, and three streaks across the ring. She had six blows
with a chain in the space of half-an-hour; and she had one
remarkable one, with six streaks across her arm. Ann Putnam, Jr.,
also was bitten by the spectre of the said Rebecca Nurse about two
o'clock of the day. I, Edward Putnam, saw the marks, both of bite
and chains."</p>
<p>It was a great hardship in all these trials,
that the prisoners were not allowed any counsel; while on the other
hand, the members of the Court seemed to take it for granted from
the first, that they were guilty. The only favor allowed them was
the right of objecting to a certain extent to those jurors whose
fairness they mistrusted.</p>
<p>One of the accused, a reputable and aged
farmer named Giles Corey, refused to plead. His wife, Martha Corey,
was among the convicted. At her examination, some time previous, he
had allowed himself to testify in certain respects against
her;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg
196]</a></span> involved as he was for a time in the prevailing
delusion. But he was a man of strong mind and character; and though
not entirely able to throw off the chains which superstition had
woven around him, he repented very sorely the part he had taken
against his wife. This was enough to procure his own accusation.
The "afflicted girls" brought their usual complaints that his
spectre tormented them. They fell down and shrieked so wildly at
his examination, that Squire Hathorne asked him with great
indignation, "Is it not enough that you should afflict these girls
at other times without doing it now in our presence?"</p>
<p>The honest and sturdy man was visibly
affected. He knew he was not consciously doing anything; but what
could it all mean? If he turned his head, the girls said he was
hurting them and turned their heads the same way. The Court ordered
his hands tied&mdash;and then the girls said they were easier. But
he drew in his cheeks, after a habit he had, and the cheeks of the
girls were sucked in also, giving them great pain. The old man was
fairly dumfounded. When however one of the girls testified that
Goodman Corey had told her that he saw the devil in the shape of a
black hog in the cow-house, and was very much frightened
by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg
197]</a></span> it, the spirited old man said that he never was
frightened by man or devil in his life.</p>
<p>But he had a fair property, and two
sons-in-law to whom he wished to leave it. He knew well that if he
were tried he would be convicted, and that would carry with it the
confiscation of his property. So, as other noble-hearted men had
done in that and the previous age, he refused when brought before
the Special Court, to plead either "guilty" or "not guilty." In
these later times the presiding Judge would simply order a plea of
"not guilty" to be entered, and the trial would proceed. But then
it was otherwise&mdash;the accused himself must plead, or the trial
could not go on. Therefore he must be made to plead&mdash;by
placing heavy weights upon his breast, and adding to them until the
accused either agreed to plead, or died under the torture. In which
last case, the prisoner lost his life as contumacious; but gained
his point of preserving his estate, and title of nobility if he had
any, to his family.</p>
<p>So, manly old Giles Corey, remorseful for the
fate he had helped to bring upon his wife, and determined that his
children should inherit the property he had acquired, maintained a
determined silence when brought before the Special<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Court. Being warned, again and again, he simply smiled. He could
bear all that they in their cruel mockery of justice could inflict
upon him.</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam and Master Raymond rode down to
Salem that day&mdash;to the orchard where the brave old man was led
out of jail to meet his doom. They saw him, tied hand and foot, and
heavy flat stones and iron weights laid one by one upon
him.</p>
<p>"More! More!" pleaded the old man at last. "I
shall never yield. But, if ye be men, make the time
short!"</p>
<p>"I cannot stand this," said Master
Raymond.</p>
<p>"We are powerless to help him&mdash;let us
go."</p>
<p>"To torture an old man of eighty years in
this way! What a sight for this new world!" exclaimed Master
Putnam, as they turned their horses' heads and rode off.</p>
<p>His executioners took Giles Corey at his
word. They knew the old man would never yield. So they mercifully
heaped the heavy weights upon him until they had crushed out his
life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id=

<h4>Dulcibel's Life in Prison.</h4>
<p>Dulcibel's life in prison was of course a
very monotonous one. She did not suffer however as did many other
women of equally gentle nature. In the jails of Ipswich, Boston and
Cambridge, there were keepers who conformed in most cases strictly
to the law. In many instances delicate and weakly women, often of
advanced years, were chained, hands and feet, with heavy irons,
night and day.</p>
<p>But Robert Foster and his son, who assisted
him as under-keeper, while indulging before the marshal and the
constables in the utmost violence and severity of language, and who
were supposed to be strict enforcers of all the instructions
received from the magistrates, were as we have seen, at heart, very
liberal and kind-hearted men. And the only fear the prisoners had,
was that they would throw up their positions some day in disgust.
Uncle Robie often declared to Dulcibel that he would, when she was
once fairly out of the clutches of her enemies.</p>
<p>Every now and then instructions would come
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg
200]</a></span> jailer Foster from one of the
magistrates&mdash;generally Squire Hathorne&mdash;to put heavier
irons on some one of the prisoners, whose spectre was still
tormenting the "afflicted girls." It being generally held that the
more heavily you chained a witch, the less able she was to afflict
her victims. And at these times Master Foster would get out his
heaviest irons, parade them before the eyes of the constables,
declare in a fierce tone what he was about to do, get the constable
off on one pretext or another&mdash;and do nothing.</p>
<p>It was thought best and wisest for neither
Master Joseph Putnam nor Master Raymond to seek many interviews
with Dulcibel; the means of intercourse between the two lovers
being restricted to little notes, which goodwife Buckley, who
frequently visited the maiden, transmitted from one to the other
through the agency of either her husband or of Joseph Putnam. This
kept them both in heart; and Dulcibel being sustained by the
frequent assurances of her lover's devotion, and by the hope of
escape, kept the roses of her cheeks in marvelous bloom during her
close confinement.</p>
<p>One of the constables, who managed to get
sight of her one day through the half-opened door of her cell,
expressed surprise to the jailer that she should<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
still look so blooming, considering the weight of the heavy chains
to which she was continually subjected.</p>
<p>"And why should not the young witch look so?"
replied the jailer. "Is not her spectre riding around on that
devil's mare half the night, and having a good time of
it?"</p>
<p>The constable assented to this view of the
case; and his suspicions, if he had any, were quieted. In fact even
Squire Hathorne himself probably would have been perfectly
satisfied with an explanation of so undeniable a
character.</p>
<p>Of course it was not considered prudent by
Uncle Robie, that the furniture or general appearance of Dulcibel's
cell should be changed in the least for the better. Not even a
bunch of flowers that Goodwife Buckley once brought to Dulcibel,
could be allowed to remain there. While in a corner of the cell,
lay the heavy chains which, if the marshal or one of the
magistrates, should insist upon seeing the prisoner, could be
slipped on her wrists and ankles in a few minutes. Fortunately,
however, for Dulcibel, the interest of all these was now centered
upon the trials that were in progress, the contumacious obstinacy
of Giles Corey, the host of new accusations at Ipswich and other
neighbor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg
202]</a></span>ing places, and the preparations for the execution
of those already condemned to death.</p>
<p>If they had a passing thought of the young
witch Dulcibel Burton, it was that her time would come rapidly
around in its turn, when speedy justice no doubt would be done to
her.</p>
<p>As to Antipas, her faithful servitor, he had
relapsed again into his old staidness and sobriety in the
comparative quietude of the prison. Only on the day of Giles
Corey's execution had the prevailing excitement attending that
event, and which naturally affected the constables and jailers,
made him raging. To pass the constable's inspection, as well as for
his own safety, the jailer had chained him; but his voice could be
heard ringing through the closed door of his cell at intervals from
morning till evening.</p>
<p>The burden of his thoughts seemed to be a
blending of denunciation and exultation. The predictions of the
four Quakers executed many years before on Boston common, and those
of men and women who had been whipped at the cart's tail through
the towns of the colony, evidently seemed to him in progress of
fulfillment:&mdash;</p>
<p>"They have torn the righteous to pieces; now
the judgment is upon them, and they are tearing<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> each
other! Woe to the bloody towns of Boston and Salem and Ipswich!
Satan is let loose by the Lord upon them! They have slain the
saints, they have supped full of innocent blood; now the blood of
their own sons, their own daughters, is filling the cup of God's
vengeance! They have tortured the innocent women, the innocent
children&mdash;and banished them and sold them to the Philistines
as slaves. But the Lord will avenge His own elect! They are given
up to believe a lie! The persecutors are persecuting each other!
They are pressing each other to death beneath heavy stones! They
are hanging each other on the gallows of Haman! Where they hung the
innocent, they are hanging themselves! Oh, God! avenge now the
blood of thy Saints! As they have done, let it be done unto them!
Whip and kill! Whip and kill! Ha! ha! ha!"&mdash;and with a
blood-curdling laugh that rang through the narrow passages of the
prison, the insane old man would fall down for a time on his bed
exhausted.</p>
<p>That was an awful day, both outside and
inside the prison&mdash;for all the prisoners knew what a savage
death old Giles Corey was meeting. It seemed to Dulcibel
afterwards, that if she had not been sustained by the power of
love, and a hopeful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id=
"Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> looking forward to other scenes, she
must have herself gone crazy during that and the other evil days
that were upon them. To some of the prisoners, the most fragile and
sensitive ones, even the hour of their execution seemed to come as
a relief. Anything, to get outside of those close dark
cells&mdash;and to make an end of it!</p>

<h4>Eight Legal Murders on Witch
Hill.</h4>
<p>A mile or so outside of the town of Salem,
the ground rises into a rocky ledge, from the top of which, to the
south and the east and the west, a vast expanse of land and sea is
visible. You overlook the town; the two rivers, or branches of the
sea, between which the town lies; the thickly wooded country, as it
was then, to the south and west; and the wide, open sea to the
eastward.</p>
<p>Such a magnificent prospect of widespread
land and water is seldom seen away from the mountain regions; and,
as one stands on the naked brow of the hill, on a clear summer day,
as the sunset begins to dye the west, and gazes on the scene before
and around him, he feels that the heavens are not so very far
distant, and as if he could almost touch with these mortal hands
the radiance and the glory.</p>
<p>The natural sublimity of this spot seems to
have struck the Puritan fathers of Salem, and looking around on its
capabilities, they appear to have come to the conclusion that of
all places it was the one expressly designed by the loving Father
of mankind for&mdash;a gallows!<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, the very spot for a gallows!" said the
first settlers. "The very spot!" echoed their descendants. "See,
the wild "Heathen Salvages" can behold it from far and near; the
free spoken, law-abiding sailors can descry it, far out at sea; and
both know by this sign that they are approaching a land of
Christian civilization and of godly law!"</p>
<p>I think if I were puzzled for an emblem to
denote the harsher and more uncharitable side of the Puritan
character, I should pick out this gallows on Witch Hill near Salem,
as being a most befitting one.</p>
<p>This was the spot where, as we have already
related, approaching it from the north, Master Raymond had his
interview with jailer Foster. But that was night, and it was so
dark that Master Raymond had no idea of its commanding so fine a
view of both land and water. He had been in Boston during the
execution of poor Bridget Bishop; and though he had often seen the
gallows from below, and wondered at the grim taste which had reared
it in such a conspicuous spot, he had never felt the least desire,
but rather a natural aversion, to approach the place where such an
unrighteous deed had been enacted.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
<p>But now the carpenters had been again at work
and supplanted the old scaffolding by another and larger one. Now
the uprights had been added too&mdash;and on the beam which they
supported there was room for at least ten persons. This seemed to
be enough space to Marshall Herrick and Squire Hathorne; though at
the rate the arrests and convictions were going on, it might be
that one-half of the people in the two Salems and in Ipswich, would
be hung in the course of a year or so by the other half.</p>
<p>But for this special hanging, only eight
ropes and nooses were prepared. The workmen had been employed the
preceding afternoon; and now in the fresh morning light, everything
was ready; and eight of those who had been condemned were to be
executed.</p>
<p>The town, and village, and country around
turned out, as was natural, in a mass, to see the terrible sight.
And yet the crowd was comparatively a small one, the colony then
being so thinly settled. But this, to Master Raymond's eyes, gave a
new horror to the scene. If there had been a crowd like that when
London brought together its thousands at Tyburn, it would have
seemed less appalling. But here were a few
people&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id=
"Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> alienated from each other by
ancestral differences in creed or politics, and who had never seen
each other's faces before&mdash;but members of the same little band
which had fled together from their old home, holding the same
political views, the same religious faith; who had sat on the same
benches at church, eaten at the same table of the Lord's supper,
near neighbors on their farms, or in the town and village streets;
now hunting each other down like wolves, and hanging each other up
in cold blood! This it was that set apart the Salem persecution
from all other persecutions of those old days against witches and
heretics; and which has given it a painful pre-eminence in horror.
It was neighbor hanging neighbor; and brother and sister
persecuting to death with the foulest lies and juggling tricks
their spiritual brothers and sisters. And the plea of "delusion"
will not excuse it, except to those who have not investigated its
studied cruelty and malice. Sheer, unadulterated wickedness had its
full share in the persecution; and that wickedness can only be
partly extenuated by the plea of possible insanity or of demoniacal
possession.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id=
"Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>The route to the gallows hill was a
rough and difficult one; but the condemned were marched from the
jail for the last time, one by one, and compelled to walk attended
by a small guard and a rude and jeering company. There was Rebecca
Nurse, infirm but venerable and lovely, the beloved mother of a
large family; there was the Reverend George Burroughs, a small dark
man, whose great physical strength was enough, as the Reverend
Increase Mather, then President of Harvard College, said, to prove
he was a witch; but who did not believe in infant baptism, and
probably was not up to the orthodox standard of the day in other
respects, though in conduct a very correct and exemplary man; there
was old John Procter, with his two staffs, and long thin white
hair; there was John Willard, a good, innocent young man, lied to
death by Susanna Sheldon, aged eighteen; there was unhappy Martha
Carrier four of whose children, one a girl of eight, had been
frightened into testifying before the Special Court against her;
saying that their mother had taken them to a witch meeting, and
that the Devil had promised her that she should be queen of hell;
there was gentle, patient and saintlike Elizabeth How, with
"Father, forgive them!" on her mild lips; and two others of whom we
now know little, save that they were most falsely and wickedly
accused.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg
210]</a></span></p>
<p>There also were the circle of the
"afflicted," gazing with hard dry eyes on the murder they had done
and with jeers and scoffs on their thin and cruel lips.</p>
<p>There, too, were the reverend ministers,
Master Parris of Salem village, and Master Noyes of Salem town, and
Master Cotton Mather, who had come down from Boston in his black
clothes, like a buzzard that scents death and blood a long way off,
to lend his spiritual countenance to the terrible
occasion.</p>
<p>Master Noyes, however, the most of the time,
seemed rather quiet and subdued. He was thinking perhaps of Sarah
Good's fierce prediction, when he urged her, as she came up to the
gallows to confess, saying to her that, "she was a witch, and she
knew it!" Outraged beyond all endurance at this last insult at such
a moment, Sarah Good cried out: "It is a lie! I am no more a witch
than you are. God will yet give you blood to drink for this day's
cruel work!" Which prediction it is said in Salem, came
true&mdash;Master Noyes dying of an internal hemorrhage bleeding
profusely at the mouth.</p>
<p>It was not a scene that men of sound and
kindly hearts would wish to witness; and yet Joseph Putnam and
Ellis Raymond felt drawn to it by an<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> irresistible sense of
duty. Hard, indeed, it was for Master Raymond; for the necessity of
the case compelled him to suppress all show of sympathy with the
sufferer, in order that he might more effectually carry out his
plans for Dulcibel's escape from the similar penalty that menaced
her. And he, therefore, could not even ride around like Master
Putnam, with a frowning face, uttering occasional emphatic
expressions of his indignation and horror, that the crowd would
probably not have endured from any one else.</p>
<p>There were some incidents that were
especially noticeable. Samuel Wardwell had "confessed" in his fear,
but subsequently taken back his false confession, and met his
death. While he was speaking at the foot of the gallows declaring
his innocence, the tobacco smoke from the pipe of the executioner,
blew into his face and interrupted him.</p>
<p>Then one of the accusing girls laughed out,
and said that "the Devil did hinder him," but Joseph Putnam cried,
"If the Devil does hinder him, then it is good proof that he is not
one of his." At which some few of the crowd applauded; while others
said that Master Putnam himself was no better than he ought to
be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg
212]</a></span></p>
<p>The Reverend Master Burroughs, when upon the
ladder, addressing the crowd, asserted earnestly his entire
innocence. Such was the effect of his words that Master Raymond
even hoped that an effort would be made to rescue him. But one of
the "afflicted girls" cried out, "See! there stands the black man
in the air at his side."</p>
<p>Then another said, "The black man is telling
him what to say."</p>
<p>But Master Burroughs answered: "Then I will
repeat the Lord's prayer. Would the Devil tell me to say
that?"</p>
<p>But when he had ended, Master Cotton Mather,
who was riding around on his horse, said to the people that "the
Devil often transformed himself into an angel of light; and that
Master Burroughs was not a rightly ordained minister;" and the
executioner at a sign from the official, cut the matter short by
turning off the condemned man.</p>
<p>Rebecca Nurse and the other women, with the
exception of their last short prayers, said
nothing&mdash;submitting quietly and composedly to their legal
murder. And before the close of one short hour eight lifeless
bodies hung dangling beneath the summer sun.</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam and Master Raymond, and
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg
213]</a></span> few others upon whom the solemn words of the
condemned had made an evident impression, turned away from the sad
sight, and wiped their tearful eyes. But Master Parris and Master
Noyes, and Master Cotton Mather seemed rather exultant than
otherwise; though Master Noyes did say; "What a sad thing it is to
see eight firebrands of hell hanging there!" But, as Master Cotton
Mather more consistently answered: "Why should godly ministers be
sad to see the firebrands of hell in the burning."</p>
<p>Then, as the hours went on, the bodies were
cut down, and stuck into short and shallow graves, dug out with
difficulty between the rocks&mdash;in some instances, the ground
not covering them entirely. There some remained without further
attention; but, in the case of others, whose relatives were still
true to them, there came loving hands by night, and bore the
remains away to find a secret sepulcher, where none could molest
them.</p>
<p>But the gallows remained on the Hill, where
it could be seen from a great distance; causing a thrill of wonder
in the bosom of the wandering savage, as of the wandering sailor,
gazing at its skeleton outline against the sunset sky from far out
at sea&mdash;waiting for ten more victims!</p>

<h4>A New Plan of Escape.</h4>
<p>About this time a new plan of escape was
suggested to Master Raymond; coming to him in a note from
Dulcibel.</p>
<p>Master Philip English, one of the wealthiest
inhabitants of Salem town, and his wife Mary, had been
arrested&mdash;the latter a short time previous to her husband. He
was a merchant managing a large business, owning fourteen houses in
the town, a wharf, and twenty-one vessels. He had one of the best
dwellings in Salem&mdash;situated at its eastern end, and having a
fine outlook over the adjacent seas. He had probably offended some
one in his business transactions; or, supposing that he was safely
entrenched in his wealth and high social position, he might have
expressed some decided opinions, relative to Mistress Ann Putnam
and the "afflicted children."</p>
<p>As for his wife, she was a lady of exalted
character who had been an only child and had inherited a large
property from her father. The deputy-marshall, Manning, came to
arrest her in the night time, during her husband's absence. She
had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg
215]</a></span> retired to her bed; but he was admitted to her
chamber, where he read the warrant for her apprehension. He allowed
her till morning, however, placing guards around the house that she
might not escape. Knowing that such an accusation generally meant
conviction and death, "she arose calmly in the morning, attended
the family prayers, spoke to a near relative of the best plan for
the education of her children, kissed them with great composure,
amid their agony of cries and tears, and then told the officer that
she was ready to die."</p>
<p>On her examination the usual scene ensued,
and the usual falsehoods were told. Perhaps the "afflicted girls"
were a little more bitter than they would have been, had she not
laughed outright at a portion of their testimony. She was a very
nice person in her habits, and it was testified against her, that
being out one day in the streets of Salem walking around on visits
to her friends during a whole morning, notwithstanding the streets
were exceedingly sloppy and muddy, it could not be perceived that
her shoes and white stockings were soiled in the least. As we have
said, at this singular proof of her being a witch, the intelligent
lady had laughed outright. And this of course brought<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> out
the additional statement, that she had been carried along on the
back of an invisible "familiar"&mdash;a spectral blue boar&mdash;the
whole way. Of course this was sufficient, and she was committed
for trial.</p>
<p>And now wealthy Master Philip English and his
wife were both in prison; and he daily concocting plans by which he
might find himself on the deck of the fastest sailer of all those
twenty-one vessels of his.</p>
<p>Uncle Robie had thought this might be also a
good opportunity for Dulcibel. And it struck Master Raymond the
same way; while Master English had no objection, especially as it
was mainly for Dulcibel that the jailer would open the prison
doors. And this was better than the violence he had at first
contemplated; for, as his vessels gradually began to accumulate in
port, owing to the interruption to his business caused by his
arrest, he had only to give the word, and a party of his sailors
would have broken open the prison some dark night, and released him
from captivity.</p>
<p>The "Albatross," Master English's fastest
sailer at length came into port; and the arrangements were speedily
made. The first north-westerly<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> wind, whether the
night were clear or stormy&mdash;though of course with such a wind
it would probably be clear&mdash;the attempt was to be made,
immediately after midnight. Uncle Robie was to unlock the
jail-doors, let them out, lock the doors again behind them, and
have a plentiful supply of witch stories to account for the escape.
And Master Raymond had some hopes also, that Abigail Williams would
come to the jailer's support in anything that seemed to compromise
him in the least; for he had promised to send her a beautiful gift
from England, when he returned home again. And with such a
sharpener to the vision, the precocious child would be able to see
even more wonderful things than any she had already testified
to.</p>
<p>The favorable wind came at length, and with
it an exceedingly propitious night; there being a moon just large
enough to enable them to see their way, with not enough light to
disclose anything sharply. Master Raymond had planned all along to
take Dulcibel's horse also with them; and if he could ride the
animal, it would obviate the necessity of taking another horse
also, and being plagued what to do with it when they arrived at the
prison. For he was very desirous that Master<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Putnam should not be in the least involved in the
matter.</p>
<p>Master Raymond therefore had been practising
up in the woods for about a week, at what the minister had failed
so deplorably in, the riding of the little black mare. At first he
could absolutely do nothing with her; she would not be ridden by
any male biped. But finally he adopted a suggestion of quick-witted
Mistress Putnam. He put on a side saddle and a skirt, and rode the
animal woman fashion&mdash;and all without the least difficulty.
The little mare seeming to say by her behavior, "Ah, now, that is
sensible. Why did you not do it before?"</p>
<p>So, late on the evening appointed for the
attempted escape, after taking an affectionate leave of his host
and hostess, and putting a few necessary articles of apparel into a
portmanteau strapped behind the saddle, Master Raymond started for
Salem town.</p>
<p>Leaving the village to the right, he made
good time to the town, meeting no one at that late hour. He had
covered the mare with a large horse-blanket, so that she should not
easily be recognized by any one who might happen to meet them.
There was a night watchman in Salem town; but a party<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> of
sailors had undertaken to get him off the principal street at the
appointed hour, by the offer of refreshments at one of their
haunts; and by this time he was too full of Jamaica spirits to walk
very steadily or see very clearly.</p>
<p>Arrived at the prison, Master Raymond found
the Captain and mate of the "Albatross" impatiently awaiting him.
It was not full time yet, but they concluded to give the signal,
three hoots of an owl; which the mate gave with great force and
precision. Still all seemed dark and quiet as before.</p>
<p>Then they waited, walking up and down to keep
the blood in their veins in motion, as the nights were a little
cool.</p>
<p>"It is full time now," said the Captain,
"give the signal again, Brady."</p>
<p>Brady gave it&mdash;if anything with greater
force and precision than before.</p>
<p>But not a sign from within.</p>
<p>Had the jailer's courage given away at the
last moment? Or could he have betrayed them? They paced up and down
for an hour longer. It was evident that, for some reason or other,
the plan had miscarried.</p>
<p>"Well, there is no use awaiting here,"
exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg
220]</a></span> the Captain of the "Albatross" with an oath; "I am
going back to the ship."</p>
<p>Master Raymond acquiesced. There was no use
in waiting longer. And so he re-donned his petticoat&mdash;much to
the amusement of the seamen and started back to Master Putnam's
arriving there in the darkest hours of the night, just before the
breaking of the day.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id=

<h4>Why the Plan Failed.</h4>
<p>The reason of the failure of the plan of
escape may be gathered from a little conversation that took place
between Squire Hathorne and Thomas Putnam the morning of the day
fixed upon by Master Philip English.</p>
<p>Thomas Putnam had called to see the
magistrate at the suggestion of that not very admirable but
certainly very sharp-witted wife of his. I do not suppose that
Thomas Putnam was at all a bad man, but it is a lamentable sight to
see, as we so often do, a good kind honest-hearted man made a mere
tool of by some keen-witted and unscrupulous woman; in whose
goodness he believes, in a kind of small-minded and yet not
altogether ignoble spirit of devotion, mainly because she is a
woman. Being a woman, she cannot be, as he foolishly supposes, the
shallow-hearted, mischievous being that she really is.</p>
<p>"Do you know, Squire, how Master English's
sailors are talking around the wharves?"</p>
<p>"No! What are the rascals saying?"</p>
<p>"Well, Mistress Putnam has been told by
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg
222]</a></span> friend of hers in the town, that he heard a
half-drunken sailor, belonging to one of Master English's vessels,
say that they meant to tear down the jail some night, hang the
jailers, and carry off their Master and Mistress."</p>
<p>"Ah," said the Squire, "this must be looked
into."</p>
<p>"Another of the sailors is reported to have
said, that if the magistrates attempted to hang Mistress English
they would hang Squire Hathorne, and Squire Gedney, if they could
catch him, by the side of her."</p>
<p>"The impudent varlets!" exclaimed Squire
Hathorne, his wine-red face growing redder. "Master English shall
sweat for this. How many of his sailors are in port
now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I suppose there are fifty of them; and
all reckless, unprincipled men. To my certain knowledge, there is
not a member of church among them."</p>
<p>"The godless knaves!" cried the magistrate.
"I should like to set the whole lot of them in the stocks, and then
whip them out of the town at the cart's tail."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is what they deserve, but then we
cannot forget that they are necessary to the inter<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>ests
of the town&mdash;unless Salem is to give up all her shipping
business&mdash;and these sailors are so clannish that if you strike
one of them, you strike all. No, it seems to me, Squire, we had
better take no public notice of their vaporing; but simply adopt
means to counteract any plans they may be laying."</p>
<p>"Well, what would you suggest, Master Putnam?
Has Mistress Putnam any ideas upon the subject? I have always found
her a very sensible woman."</p>
<p>"Yes, my wife is a very remarkable woman if I
do say it," replied Master Putnam. "Her plan is to send Master
English and his wife off at once to Boston&mdash;that will save us
all further trouble with them and their sailors."</p>
<p>"A capital idea! It shall be carried out this
very day," said the magistrate.</p>
<p>"And she also suggests that the young witch
woman, Dulcibel Burton, should be sent with them. That friend of my
brother Joseph, is still staying around here; and Mistress Putnam
does not exactly comprehend his motives for so long a
visit."</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed&mdash;what motive has he?" And
Squire Hathorne rubbed his broad forehead.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg
224]</a></span></p>
<p>"There was some talk at one time of his
keeping company with Mistress Burton."</p>
<p>"What, the witch! that is too bad. For he
seems like a rather pleasant young gentleman; and I hear he is the
heir of a large estate in the old country."</p>
<p>"Of course there may be nothing in
it&mdash;but Mistress Putnam also heard from one of her female
cronies the other day, that jailer Foster was at one time a mate on
board Captain Burton's vessel."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"And you know how very handsome that Mistress
Dulcibel is; and, being besides a witch of great power, it seems to
Mistress Putnam that it is exposing jailer Foster to very great
temptation."</p>
<p>"Mistress Putnam is quite correct," said
Squire Hathorne. "Mistress Dulcibel had better be transferred to
Boston also. There the worshipful Master Haughton has the power and
the will to see that all these imps of Satan are kept
safely."</p>
<p>"As the seamen may be lying around and make a
disturbance if the removal comes to their knowledge, Mistress
Putnam suggested that it had better<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> not be done until
evening. It would be a night ride; but then, as Mistress Putnam
said, witches rather preferred to make their journeys in the night
time&mdash;so that it would be a positive kindness to the
prisoners."</p>
<p>"Very true! very well thought of!" replied
Squire Hathorne, with a grim smile. "And no doubt they will be very
thankful that we furnish them with horses instead of broomsticks.
Though as for Mistress Dulcibel, I suppose she would prefer her
familiar, the black mare, to any other animal."</p>
<p>"That was very marvelous. Abigail Williams
says that she is certain that the mare, after jumping the gate,
never came down to earth again, but flew straight on up into the
thundercloud."</p>
<p>"And it thundered when the black beast
entered the cloud, did it not?" said the magistrate in a sobered
tone. He evidently saw nothing unreasonable in the
story.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;it thundered&mdash;but not the
common kind of thunder&mdash;it was enough to make your flesh
creep. The minister says he is only too thankful that the Satanic
beast did throw him off. He might have been carried off to hell
with her."</p>
<p>"Yes, it was a very foolish thing to get on
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg
226]</a></span> back of a witch's familiar," said the magistrate.
"It was tempting Providence. And Master Parris has cause for
thankfulness that only such a mild reproof as a slight wetting, was
allowed to be inflicted upon him. These are perilous times, Master
Putnam. Satan is truly going about like a roaring lion, seeking
what he may devour. Against this chosen seed,&mdash;this little
remnant of God's people left upon the whole earth&mdash;no wonder
that he is tearing and raging."</p>
<p>"Ah me, my Christian friend, it is too true!
And no wonder that he is so bold, and full of joyful subtlety. For
is he not prevailing, in spite of all our efforts? You know there
are at least four hundred members of what rightly calls itself the
Church of England&mdash;for certainly it is not the church of
Christ&mdash;in Boston alone! When the royal Governor made the town
authorities give up the South Church&mdash;even our own Church,
built with our own money&mdash;to their so-called Rector to hold
their idolatrous services in, we might have known that Satan was at
our doors!"</p>
<p>"Oh, that such horrible things should happen
in the godly town of Boston!" responded Squire Hathorne. "But when
the King interfered between Justice and the Quakers, and
forbade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg
227]</a></span> the righteous discipline we were exercising upon
them, of course a door was opened for all other latitudinarianism
and false doctrine. Why, I am told that there are now quite a
number of Quakers in Boston; and that they even had the assurance
to apply to the magistrates the other day, for permission to erect
a meeting-house!"</p>
<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Master Putnam. "They
ought to have been whipped out of their presence."</p>
<p>"Yes," continued the worthy Magistrate
irefully; "but when the King ordered that the right of voting for
our rulers should no longer be restricted to church-members; but
that every man of fair estate and good moral character, as he
phrases it, should be allowed to vote, even if he is not a member
at all, he aimed a blow at the very Magistracy itself."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is worse than heresy! And how can
a man possess a good moral character, without being a member of the
true church?"</p>
<p>"Of course&mdash;that is self-evident. But it
shows how the righteous seed is being over-flooded with iniquity,
even in its last chosen house; how our Canaan is being given up to
the Philistines. And therefore it is, doubtless, that Satan, in the
pride<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg
228]</a></span> of his success, is introducing his emissaries into
the very house of the Lord itself; and promising great rewards to
them who will bow down and sign their names in his red book, and
worship him. Ah! we have fallen on evil times, Master
Putnam."</p>
<p>And so the two worthy Puritans condoled with
each other, until, Master Putnam, bethinking himself that he had
some worldly business to attend to, Squire Hathorne proceeded to
give the necessary directions for the removal of the three
prisoners from Salem to Boston jail.</p>
<p>This was accomplished that very night, as
Mistress Putnam had suggested; Deputy Marshall Herrick and a
constable guarding the party. Dulcibel occupied a pillion behind
jailer Foster; Master English and his wife rode together; while
Master Herrick and the constable each had a horse to
himself.</p>
<p>The original plan was for Dulcibel to ride
behind Master Herrick; but upon jailer Foster representing that
there might be some danger of a rescue, and offering to join the
party, it was arranged that he should have special charge of
Mistress Dulcibel, whom he represented to Herrick as being in his
opinion a most marvelous witch.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>
<p>Uncle Robie's true reason for going, however,
was that the jailer in Boston was an old friend of his, and he
wished to speak a secret word to him that might insure Dulcibel
kinder treatment than was usually given in Boston jail to any
alleged transgressor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id=

<h4>Mistress Ann Putnam's Fair
Warning.</h4>
<p>In the course of the next day the removal of
the three prisoners became known to everybody. Master Raymond
wondered when he heard it, whether it was a check-mate to the plan
of escape, with which the magistrates, in some way had become
acquainted; or whether it was a mere chance coincidence. Finally he
satisfied himself that it was the latter&mdash;though no doubt
suggested by the rather loose threats of Master English's many
sailors.</p>
<p>When jailer Foster returned, he found means
to inform Master Raymond that it had been entirely
impossible&mdash;so suddenly was the whole thing sprung upon
him&mdash;to let anyone in their secret know of what was going on.
He had not even taken the assistant jailer, his own son, into his
confidence, because he did not wish to expose him to needless
danger. His son was not required to afford any help, and therefore
it would be unwise to incur any risk of punishment. Besides, while
Uncle Robie had made up his mind to do some tall lying of his own
for the sake of saving innocent<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> lives, he saw no
reason why his son, should be placed under a similar necessity.
Lying seemed to be absolutely needful in the case; but it was well
to do as little of it as possible.</p>
<p>From his conversation with Master Herrick,
Uncle Robie concluded that nothing had been divulged; and that the
magistrates had acted only on the supposition that trouble of some
kind might result from the sailors. And, looked at from that point
of view, it was quite sufficient to account for the removal of two
of the prisoners. As to why Dulcibel also should be sent to Boston,
he could get no satisfactory explanation. It seemed in fact to be a
matter of mere caprice, so far as uncle Robie could find
out.</p>
<p>They had pushed on through the night to
Boston&mdash;about a four hours' slow ride&mdash;and delivered the
three prisoners safely to the keeper of Boston jail. Uncle Robie
adding the assurance to Goodwife Buckley&mdash;who acted as Master
Raymond's confidential agent in the matter&mdash;that he had spoken
a word to his old crony who believed no more in witches than he
did, which would insure to her as kind treatment as possible. And
Robie further said that he had been assured by the Boston jailer,
that Mistress Phips, the wife of the Gov<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg
232]</a></span>ernor, had no sympathy whatever with the witchcraft
prosecutions, but a great deal of sympathy for the victims of
it.</p>
<p>The game was therefore played out at Salem,
now that Dulcibel had been transferred to Boston; and Master
Raymond began to make arrangements at once to leave the place. In
some respects the change of scene was for the worse; for he had no
hold upon the Boston jailer, and had no friend there like Joseph
Putnam, prepared to go to any length on his behalf. But, on the
other hand, in Boston they seemed outside of the circle of Mistress
Ann Putnam's powerful and malign influence. This of itself was no
small gain; and, thinking over the whole matter, Master Raymond
came to the conclusion that perhaps the chances of escape would be
even greater in Boston than in Salem.</p>
<p>So, in the course of the ensuing week, Master
Raymond took an affectionate leave of his kind young host and
hostess, and departed for Boston town, avowedly on his way back to
his English home. This last was of course brought out prominently
in all his leave-takings&mdash;he was, after a short stay in
Boston, to embark for England. "What shall I send you from
England?" was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id=
"Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> among his last questions to the
various members of the "afflicted circle." And one said laughingly
one thing, and one another; the young man taking it gravely, and
making a note in his little notebook of each request. If things
should come to the worst, he was putting himself in a good position
to influence the character of the testimony. A hundred pounds in
this way would be money well employed.</p>
<p>Even to Mistress Ann Putnam he did not
hesitate to put the same question, after a friendly leave-taking.
Mistress Putnam rather liked the young Englishman; it was mainly
against Dulcibel as the friend of her brother-in-law that she had
warred; and if Master Raymond had not also been the warm friend and
guest of Joseph Putnam, she might have relented in her persecution
of Dulcibel for his sake. But her desire to pain and punish Master
Joseph,&mdash;who had said so many things against her in the Putnam
family&mdash;overpowered all such sentimental considerations.
Besides, what Dulcibel had said of her when before the magistrates,
had greatly incensed her.</p>
<p>"What shall you send me from England? And are
you really going back there?" And she fixed her cold green eyes
upon the young man's face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234"
id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I am going back again, like the bad
penny," replied Master Raymond smiling.</p>
<p>"How soon?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I cannot say exactly. Perhaps the Boston
gentlemen may be so fascinating that they will detain me longer
than I have planned."</p>
<p>"Is it because the Salem gentlewomen are so
fascinating that you have remained here? We feel quite complimented
in the village by the length of your visit."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have found the Salem gentlewomen
among the most charming of their sex. But you have not told me what
I shall send you from London when I return?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I leave that entirely with you, and to
your own good taste. Perhaps by the time you get back to London,
you will not wish to send me anything."</p>
<p>"I cannot imagine such a case. But I shall
endeavor, as you leave it all to me, to find something pretty and
appropriate; something suited to the most gifted person, among men
and women, that I have found in the New World."</p>
<p>Mistress Putnam's face colored with evident
pleasure&mdash;even she was not averse to a compliment of this
kind; knowing, as she did, that she had a<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
wonderful intellectual capacity for planning and scheming. In fact
if she had possessed as large a heart as brain, she would have been
a very noble and even wonderful woman. Master Raymond thought he
had told no falsehood in calling her the "most gifted"&mdash;he
considered her so in certain directions.</p>
<p>And so they parted&mdash;the last words of
Mistress Putnam being, the young man thought, very significant
ones.</p>
<p>"I would not," she said in a light, but still
impressive manner, "if I were you, stay a very long time in Boston.
There is, I think, something dangerous to the health of strangers
in the air of that town, of late. It would be a very great pity for
you to catch one of our deadly fevers, and never be able to return
to your home and friends. Take my advice now&mdash;it is honest and
well meant&mdash;and do not linger long in the dangerous air of
Boston."</p>
<p>Thanking her for her solicitude as to his
health, Master Raymond shook her thin hand and departed. But all
the ride back to Joseph Putnam's, he was thinking over those last
words.</p>
<p>What was their real meaning? What could they
mean but this? "You are going to Boston to try to save Dulcibel
Burton. I do not want to hurt<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> you; but I may be
compelled to do it. Leave Boston as soon as you can, and spare me
the necessity that may arise of denouncing you also. Joseph Putnam,
whom I hate, but whose person and household I am for family reasons
compelled to respect, when you are in Boston is no longer your
protector. I can just as easily, and even far more easily, reach
you than I could reach Captain Alden. Beware how you interfere with
my plans. Even while I pity you, I shall not spare you!"</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id=

<h4>Master Raymond Goes Again to
Boston.</h4>
<p>Master Raymond had agreed to keep his friend
Joseph Putnam informed by letter of his movements&mdash;for there
had been a postal system established a number of years before
through the Massachusetts colony&mdash;but of course he had to be
very careful as to what he put upon paper; the Puritan official
mind not being over-scrupulous as to the means it took of attaining
its ends.</p>
<p>He had brought excellent letters to persons
of the highest character in Boston, and had received invitations
from many of them to make his home in their houses&mdash;for the
Boston people of all classes, and especially the wealthy, obeyed
the Scriptural injunction, and were "given to hospitality;" which I
believe is true to the present day. But Master Raymond, considering
the errand he was on, thought it wisest to take up his abode at an
Inn&mdash;lest he might involve his entertainers in the peril
attending his unlawful but righteous designs. So he took a cheery
room at the Red Lion, in the northern part of the town, which was
quite a reputable house, and convenient for many
purposes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg
238]</a></span> not the least being its proximity to the harbor,
which made it a favorite resort for the better class of
sea-captains.</p>
<p>Calling around upon the families to which he
had presented letters on his first visit, immediately after his
arrival in the colony, he speedily established very pleasant social
relations with a good many very different circles. And he soon was
able to sum up the condition of affairs in the town as
follows:</p>
<p>First, there was by far the most numerous and
the ruling sect, the Puritans. The previous Governor, shut out by
King James, Sir Edmund Andros, had been an Episcopalian; but the
present one sent out on the accession of William and Mary, Sir
William Phips, was himself a Puritan, sitting under the weekly
teachings of the Reverend Master Cotton Mather at the North
church.</p>
<p>Then there was an Episcopal circle, composed
of about four hundred people in all, meeting at King's Chapel,
built about three years before, with the Reverend Master Robert
Ratcliffe as Rector.</p>
<p>Besides these, there was a small number of
Quakers, now dwelling in peace, so far as personal manifestations
were concerned, being protected by the King's mandate. These had
even grown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id=
"Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> so bold of late, as to be seeking
permission to erect a meeting-house; which almost moved the Puritan
divines to prophesy famine, earthquakes and pestilence as the
results of such an ungodly toleration of heresy.</p>
<p>Then there were a number of Baptists, who
also now dwelt in peace, under the King's protection.</p>
<p>Adding to the foregoing the people without
any religion to speak of, who principally belonged to or were
connected with the seafaring class, and Master Raymond found that
he had a pretty clear idea of the inhabitants of Boston.</p>
<p>In relation to the Witchcraft prosecutions,
the young Englishman ascertained that the above classes seemed to
favor the prosecutions just in proportion to the extent of their
Puritan orthodoxy. The great majority of the Puritans believed
devoutly in witches, and in the duty of obeying the command, "Thou
shalt not suffer a witch to live." And generally in proportion to a
Puritan church-member's orthodoxy, was the extent of his belief in
witchcraft, and the fierceness of his exterminating
zeal.</p>
<p>The Episcopalians and the Baptists were
either very lukewarm, or else in decided opposition to the
prosecutions looking upon them as simply addi<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg
240]</a></span>tional proofs of Puritan narrowness, intolerance and
bigotry.</p>
<p>The Quakers held to the latter opinion even
more firmly than the liberal Episcopalians and Baptists: adding to
it the belief that it was a judgment allowed to come upon the
Puritans, to punish them for their cruelty to God's chosen
messengers.</p>
<p>As for the seafaring class, they looked upon
the whole affair as a piece of madness, which could only overtake
people whose contracted notions were a result of perpetually living
in one place, and that on the land. And since the arrest of a man
so well thought of, and of their own class as Captain Alden, the
vocabulary allowed by the law in Boston was entirely too limited to
embrace adequately a seaman's emphatic sense of the iniquitous
proceedings. As one of them forcibly expressed himself to Master
Raymond:&mdash;"He would be <i>condemned</i>, if he wouldn't like
to see the <i>condemned</i> town of Boston, and all its
<i>condemned</i> preachers, buried like Port Royal, ten
<i>condemned</i> fathoms deep, under the <i>condemned</i> soil upon
which it was built!" He used another emphatic word of course, in
the place of the word <i>condemned</i>; but that doubtless was
because at that time they had<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> not our "revised
version" of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The sea-captain who expressed himself in this
emphatic way to Master Raymond, was the captain in whose vessel he
had come over from England, and who had made another voyage back
and forth since that time. The young man was strolling around the
wharves, gazing at the vessels when he had been accosted by the
aforesaid captain. At that particular moment however, he had come
to a stand, earnestly regarding, as he had several times before, a
vessel that was lying anchored out in the stream.</p>
<p>After passing some additional words with the
captain upon various matters, and especially upon the witches, a
subject that every conversation at that time was apt to be very
full of, he turned towards the water and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"That seems to be a good craft out
there."</p>
<p>It was a vessel of two masts, slender and
raking, and with a long, low hull&mdash;something of the model
which a good many years later, went by the name of the Baltimore
clipper.</p>
<p>"Yes, she is a beauty!" replied the
captain.</p>
<p>"She looks as if she might be a good
sailer."</p>
<p>"Good! I reckon she is. The Storm King
can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg
242]</a></span> show her heels to any vessel that goes out of this
port&mdash;or out of London either, for that matter."</p>
<p>"What is she engaged in?"</p>
<p>Here the captain gave a low whistle, and
followed it up with a wink.</p>
<p>"Buccaneers occasionally, I
suppose?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Captain Tolley is not so very
<i>condemned</i> particular what he does&mdash;so that of course it
is entirely lawful," and the captain winked again. "He owns his
vessel, you see&mdash;carries her in his pocket&mdash;and has no
<i>condemned</i> lot of land-lubber owners on shore who cannot get
away if there is any trouble, from the <i>condemned</i> magistrates
and constables."</p>
<p>"That is an advantage sometimes," said the
young man. He was thinking of his own case probably.</p>
<p>"Of course it is. Law is a very good
thing&mdash;in its place. But if I buy a bag of coffee in the East
Indies or in South America, why should I have to pay a lot of money
on it, before I am allowed to sell it to the people that like
coffee in some other country? <i>Condemn</i> it! There's no justice
in it."</p>
<p>Master Raymond was in no mood just then to
argue great moral questions. So he answered by asking:<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg
243]</a></span>&mdash;</p>
<p>"Captain Tolley does not make too many
inquiries then when a good offer is made him?"</p>
<p>"Do not misunderstand me, young man," replied
the captain gravely. "My friend, Captain Tolley, would be the last
man to commit piracy, or anything of that kind. But just look at
the case. Here Captain Tolley is, off at sea, attending to his
proper business. Well, he comes into some <i>condemned</i> port,
just to get a little water perhaps, and some fresh provisions; and
hears that while he has been away, these <i>condemned</i>
land-lubbers have been making some new rules and regulations,
without even asking any of us seafaring men anything about it.
Then, if we do not obey their foolish rules, they nab us when we
come into port again, and fine us&mdash;perhaps put us in the
bilboes. Now, as a fair man, do you call that justice?"</p>
<p>Master Raymond laughed good-humoredly. "I see
it has its unfair side," said he. "By the way, I should like to
look over that vessel of his. Could you give me a line of
introduction to him?"</p>
<p>"Of course I can&mdash;nothing pleases Tolley
more than to have people admire his vessel&mdash;even though a
landsman's admiration, you know, really cannot seem of much account
to a sailor. But I cannot write here; let us adjourn to the
Lion."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id=
"Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
<h4>Captain Tolley and the Storm
King.</h4>
<p>The next day furnished with a brief note of
introduction, Master Raymond, with the aid of a skiff, put himself
on the deck of the Storm King. Captain Tolley received him with due
courtesy, wondering who the stranger was. The Captain was a
well-built, athletic, though not very large man, with a face
naturally dark in hue, and bronzed by exposure to the southern sun.
As Master Raymond ascertained afterwards, he was the son of an
English father and a Spanish mother; and he could speak English,
French and Spanish with equal facility. While he considered himself
an Englishman of birth, his nationality sat very loosely upon him;
and, if need be, he was just as willing to run up the French or
Spanish colors on the Storm King, as the red cross of St.
George.</p>
<p>After reading the note of introduction,
Captain Tolley gave a keen look at his visitor. "Yes, the Storm
King is a bird and a beauty," said he proudly. "Look at her! See
what great wings she has! And what a hull, to cut the seas! She was
built after my own plans. Give me plenty<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> of
sea-room, and a fair start, and I will laugh at all the gun
frigates of the royal navy."</p>
<p>"She looks to be all you say," said his
visitor admiringly&mdash;but rather surprised that not an oath had
yet fallen from the lips of the Captain. He had not learned that
Captain Tolley, to use his own language, "never washed his
ammunition in port or in mild weather." When aroused by a severe
storm or other peril, the Captain was transformed into a different
man. Then, in the war of the elements, or of man's angry passions,
he also lightened and thundered, and swore big guns.</p>
<p>"Let us go down into the cabin," said the
Captain. Reaching there, he filled a couple of glasses with wine
and putting the decanter on the table, invited his visitor to be
seated. Then, closing the door, he said with a smile, "nothing that
is said inside this cabin ever is told anywhere else."</p>
<p>There was that in the speech, bearing and
looks of Captain Tolley which inspired Master Raymond with great
confidence in him. "I feel that I may trust you, Captain," he said
earnestly.</p>
<p>"I have done business for a great many
gentlemen, and no one ever found me untrue to him," replied Captain
Tolley, proudly. "Some things<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> I will not do for
anybody, or for any price; but that ends it. I never betray
confidence."</p>
<p>"Do you believe in witches,
Captain?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I do."</p>
<p>"Well I suppose that settles it," replied the
young man in a disappointed tone, rising to his feet.</p>
<p>"I know a little witch down in Jamaica, that
has been tormenting me almost to death for the last three years.
But I tell you she is a beauty&mdash;as pretty as, as&mdash;the
Storm King! She doesn't carry quite as many petticoats though,"
added the Captain laughing.</p>
<p>"Oh! That is the kind of witch you mean!" and
Master Raymond sat down again.</p>
<p>"It is the only kind that I ever came
across&mdash;and they are bad enough for me," responded the Captain
drily.</p>
<p>"I know a little witch of that kind," said
Master Raymond, humoring the Captain's fancy; "but she is now in
Boston prison, and in danger of her life."</p>
<p>"Ah! I think I have heard something of
her&mdash;very beautiful, is she not? I caught a glimpse of her
when I went up to see Captain Alden, who the bigoted fools have got
in limbo there. I could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247"
id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> help laughing at Alden&mdash;the
idea of calling him a witch. Alden is a religious man, you
know!"</p>
<p>"But it may cost him his life!"</p>
<p>"That is what I went to see him about. I
offered to come up with a party some night, break open the jail,
and carry him off to New York in the Storm King."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you know the better people are not in
the jail, but in the jailer's house&mdash;having given their
promise to Keeper Arnold that they will not try to escape, if thus
kindly treated. And besides, if he runs off, they will confiscate
his property; of which Alden foolishly has a good deal in houses
and lands. So he thinks it the best policy to hold on to his
anchor, and see if the storm will not blow itself out."</p>
<p>"And so you have no conscientious scruples
against breaking the law, by carrying off any of these imprisoned
persons?"</p>
<p>"Conscientious scruples and the Puritan laws
be d&mdash;&mdash;!" exclaimed the Captain; thinking perhaps that
this was an occasion when he might with propriety break his rule as
to swearing while in port.</p>
<p>"Your language expresses my sentiments
ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg
248]</a></span>actly!" responded the young Englishman, who had
never uttered an oath in his life. "Captain, I am betrothed to that
young lady you saw when you went to see Captain Alden. If she is
ever brought to trial, those Salem hell-hounds will swear away her
life. I mean to rescue her&mdash;or die with her. I am able and
willing to pay you any reasonable price for your aid and
assistance, Will you help me?"</p>
<p>The Captain sprang to his feet. "Will I help
you? The great God dash the Storm King to pieces on her next voyage
if I fail you! See here," taking a letter out of a drawer, "it is a
profitable offer just made me. But it is a mere matter of
merchandise; and this is a matter of a woman's life! You shall pay
me what you can afford to, and what you think right; but, money or
no money, I and the Storm King, and her brave crew, who will follow
wherever I lead, are at your service!"</p>
<p>As Captain Tolley uttered these words, in an
impassioned, though low voice, and with a glowing face and
sparkling blue eyes, Master Raymond thought he had never seen a
handsomer man. He grasped the Captain's extended hand, and shook it
warmly. "I shall never forget this noble<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
offer," he exclaimed. And he never did forget it; for from that
moment the two were life-long friends.</p>
<p>"What is your plan?" said the
Captain.</p>
<p>"A peaceable escape if possible. If not, what
you propose to Captain Alden."</p>
<p>"I should like the last the best," said the
Captain.</p>
<p>"Why, it would expose you to
penalties&mdash;and keep your vessel hereafter out of Boston
harbor."</p>
<p>"You see that I have an old grudge of my
own," replied the Captain. "These Puritan rascals once arrested me
for bringing some Quakers from Barbados&mdash;good, honest,
innocent people, a little touched here, you know,"&mdash;and the
Captain tapped his broad, brown brow with his finger. "They caught
me on shore, fined me, and would have put me in the stocks; but my
mate got word of it, we were lying out in the storm, trained two
big guns to bear upon the town, and gave them just fifteen minutes
to send me on board again. That was twenty years ago, and I have
not been here since."</p>
<p>"They sent you on board, I
suppose?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the Saints are not fools," replied the
Captain, laughing. "As for being shut out of Boston<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
harbor hereafter, I do not fear that much. The reign of the Saints
is nearly over. Do you not see that the Quakers are back, and the
Baptists, and the prayer-book men, as they call the
Episcopalians!&mdash;and they do not touch them, though they would
whip the whole of them out of the Province, at the cart's tail, if
they dared. But there are Kings in Israel again!" and the Captain
laughed heartily. "And the Kings are always better shepherds to the
flock than the Priests."</p>
<p>"You may have to lie here idle for a while;
but I will bear the expense of it," said Master Raymond. "Have the
proper papers drawn up, and I will sign them."</p>
<p>"No, there shall be no papers between you and
me," rejoined the Captain stoutly. "I hate these lawyers' pledges.
I never deal with a man, if I can help it, who needs a signed and
sealed paper to keep him to his word. I know what you are, and you
ought to be able to see by this time what I am. The Storm King
shall lie here three months, if need be&mdash;and you shall pay me
monthly my reasonable charges. But I will make out no bill, and you
shall have no receipt, to cause any trouble to anybody,
hereafter."</p>
<p>"That will suit me," replied Master
Raymond,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg
251]</a></span> "I shall be in the bar-room of the Red Lion every
morning at ten. You must be there too. But we will only nod to each
other, unless I have something to tell you. Then I will slip a note
into your hand, making an appointment for an interview. I fear
there may be spies upon my movements."</p>
<p>Captain Tolley assenting to these
arrangements, Master Raymond and he again shook hands, and the
latter was put ashore in one of the Storm King's boats. It was a
little curious that as the young man reached the wharf, ascending a
few wooden steps from the boat, whom should he see at a little
distance, walking briskly into the town, but one who he thought was
Master Thomas Putnam. He could not see the man's face, for his back
was toward him; but he felt certain that it was the loving and
obedient husband of Mistress Ann Putnam.</p>

<h4>Sir William Phips and Lady Mary.</h4>
<p>When Mistress Dulcibel Burton, in company
with Master Philip English and his wife, arrived at Boston jail,
and were delivered into the care of Keeper Arnold, they received
far better treatment than they had expected.</p>
<p>The prison itself, situated in a portion of
Boston which is now considered the centre of fashion and elegance,
was one of those cruel Bridewells, which were a befitting
illustration of what some suppose to have been the superior manners
and customs of the "good old times." It was built of stone, its
walls being three feet thick. Its windows were barred with iron to
prevent escape; but being without glazed sashes, the wind and rain
and snow and cold of winter found ready access to the cells within.
The doors were covered with the large heads of iron
spikes&mdash;the cells being formed by partitions of heavy plank.
And the passage ways of the prison were described by one who had
been confined in this Boston Bridewell, as being "like the dark
valley of the shadow of death."</p>
<p>But the jailers seem to have been more
humane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg
253]</a></span> than the builders of the prison; and those awaiting
trial, especially, were frequently allowed rooms in the Keeper's
house&mdash;probably always paying well, however, for the
privilege.</p>
<p>Thus, as Captain Tolley had said, Captain
Alden was confined in Keeper Arnold's house; and, when the party in
which the readers of this story are especially interested, arrived
late at night from Salem, they were taken to comparatively
comfortable apartments. The jailer knew that Master Philip English
was a very wealthy man; and, as for Dulcibel, Uncle Robie did not
forget to say to his old crony Arnold, among other favorable
things, that she not only had warm friends, among the best people
of Salem, but that in her own right, she possessed a very pretty
little fortune, and was fully able to pay a good price for any
favors extended to her.</p>
<p>The magistrates in Salem had refused to take
bail for Captain Alden; but Master English was soon able to make an
arrangement, by which he and his wife were allowed the freedom of
the town in the daytime; it being understood that they should
return regularly, and pass the night in the jail&mdash;or, speaking
strictly, in the Keeper's house.</p>
<p>For things in Boston were different from
what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg
254]</a></span> they were at Salem. In Salem the Puritan spirit
reigned supreme in magistrates and in ministers. But in Boston,
there was, as we have said, a strong anti-Puritan influence. The
officials sent over from England were generally
Episcopalians&mdash;the officers of the English men-of-war
frequently in port, also were generally Episcopalians. And though
the present Governor, Sir William Phips, was a member of the North
Church, the Reverend Cotton Mather taking the place of his father,
the Reverend Increase Mather&mdash;and though the Governor was
greatly under the influence of that dogmatic and superstitious
divine&mdash;his wife, Lady Mary, was utterly opposed to the whole
witchcraft delusion and persecution.</p>
<p>Sir William himself had quite a romantic
career. Starting in life as one of the later offspring of a father
and mother who had twenty-six children, and had come as poor
emigrants to Maine, he was a simple and ignorant caretaker of sheep
until eighteen years of age. Then he became a ship carpenter; and
at the age of twenty-two went to Boston, working at his trade in
the day time, and learning how to read and write at night. In
Boston he had the good fortune to capture the heart of a fair widow
by the name of Mistress Hull,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> who was a daughter of
Captain Robert Spencer. With her hand he received a fair estate;
which was the beginning of a large fortune. For, it enabled him to
set up a ship-yard of his own; and by ventures to recover lost
treasure, sunk in shipwrecked Spanish galleons, under the patronage
of the Duke of Albemarle, he took back to England at one time the
large amount of &pound;300,000 in gold, silver and precious stones,
of which his share was &pound;16,000&mdash;and in addition a gold
cup, valued at &pound;1,000 presented to his wife Mary. And such
was the able conduct and the strict integrity he had shown in the
face of many difficulties and temptations, that King James knighted
him, making him Sir William.</p>
<p>Now, through his own deserts, and the
influence of the Reverend Increase Mather, agent in England of the
colony, he was Governor-in-Chief of the Province of Massachusetts
Bay, and Captain General (for military purposes) of all New
England. And he was living in that "fair brick house in Green
lane," which, years before, he had promised his wife that he would
some day build for her to live in.</p>
<p>Lady Mary was a very sweet, nice woman; but
she had a will of her own, and never could be<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
persuaded that Sir William's rise in the world was not owing
entirely to her having taken pity on him, and married below her
station. And really there was considerable truth in this view of
the matter, which she was not inclined to have him forget; and Sir
William, being a manly and generous, though at times rather
choleric gentleman, generally admitted the truth of her assertion
that "she had made him," rather than have any controversy with her
about it. One of the first acts of Sir William on arriving to fill
his position as Governor, was to order chains put upon all the
alleged witches in the prisons. In this order might be very plainly
traced the hand of his pastor, the Reverend Cotton Mather. Lady
Mary was outraged by such a command. One of her first visits had
been to the jail, to see Captain Alden, whom she knew well. Keeper
Arnold had shown her the order. "Put on the irons," said Lady Mary.
The jailer did so. "Now that you have obeyed Sir William, take them
off again." The jailer smiled, but hesitated. "Do as I command you,
and I will be accountable to Sir William." Very gladly did Keeper
Arnold obey&mdash;he had no faith in such accusations, brought
against some of the best behaved people he ever had in his
charge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg
257]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now, do the same to all the other
prisoners!" commanded the spirited lady.</p>
<p>"I may as well be hung for a cow as a calf,"
said the jailer laughing&mdash;and he went gravely with one pair of
fetters all through the cells, complying literally with the new
Governor's orders.</p>
<p>Of course this soon got to the ears of the
Rev. Cotton Mather, who went in high indignation to the Governor.
But the latter seemed to be very much amused, and could not be
brought to manifest any great amount of indignation. "You know that
Lady Mary has a will of her own," said he to his pastor. "If you
choose to go and talk to her, I will take you to her boudoir; but I
am not anxious to get into hot water for the sake of a few
witches." The minister thought of it a moment; but then concluded
wisely not to go. For, as Lady Mary said to her husband afterwards,
"I wish that you had brought him to me. I would have told him just
what I think of him, and his superstitious, hard-hearted doings.
For me, I never mean to enter North Church more. I shall go
hereafter to South Church; Masters Willard and Moody have some
Christian charity left in them."</p>
<p>"I think you are too hard on Master
Cot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg
258]</a></span>ton Mather, my dear," replied Sir William
mildly.</p>
<p>"Too hard, am I? What would you say if those
girl imps at Salem should accuse me next! Your own loving
wife,&mdash;to the world."</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear wife, that is too monstrous even
to think of!"</p>
<p>"No more monstrous than their accusation of
Mistress English of Salem, and her husband. You know
them&mdash;what do you think of that?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, that is very singular and
impossible; but Master Mather says&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Master Mather ought to be hung himself,"
said the indignant lady; "for he has helped to murder better people
than he is, a great deal."</p>
<p>"My dear, I must
remonstrate&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And there is Captain Alden&mdash;he is a
witch, too, it seems!" And Lady Mary laughed scornfully. "Why not
you too? You are no better a man than Captain Alden."</p>
<p>"Oh, the Captain shall not be
hurt."</p>
<p>"It will not be through any mercy of his
judges then. But, answer my question: what will you do, if they
dare to accuse me? Answer me that!"</p>
<p>"You certainly are not serious, Lady
Mary?"</p>
<p>"I am perfectly serious. I have heard
already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg
259]</a></span> a whisper from Salem that they are thinking of it.
They even have wished me warned against the consequences of my
high-handed proceedings. Now if they cry out against me, what will
you do?"</p>
<p>We have said that Sir William was naturally
choleric&mdash;though he always put a strong constraint upon
himself when talking with his wife, whom he really loved; but now
he started to his feet.</p>
<p>"If they dare to breathe a whisper against
you, my wife, Lady Mary, I will blow the whole concern to
perdition! Confound it, Madam, there are limits to
everything!"</p>
<p>She went up to him and put her arm around his
neck and kissed him. "I thought that before they touched me, they
would have to chain the lion that lies at my door," she said
proudly and affectionately; for, notwithstanding these little
tiffs, she really was fond of her husband, and proud of his
romantic career.</p>
<p>But&mdash;coming back to our
sheep&mdash;Dulcibel not having the same amount of wealth and
influence behind her as Master English had, was very well contented
at being allowed a room in Keeper Arnold's house; and was on the
whole getting along very comfortably. Master Raymond had
seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg
260]</a></span> her soon after his arrival, but it was in company
with the jailer; the principal result being that he had secretly
passed her a letter, and had assured himself that she was not in a
suffering condition.</p>
<p>But things of late were looking brighter, for
Master Raymond had made the acquaintance of Lady Mary through a
friend to whom he had letters from England, and Lady Mary had begun
to take an interest in Dulcibel, whom she had seen on one of her
visits to Mistress English.</p>
<p>Through Lady Mary, in some way, Dulcibel
hoped to escape from the prison; trusting that, if once at large,
Master Raymond would be able to provide for her safety. But there
was one great difficulty. She, with the others, had given her word
to the Keeper not to escape, as the price of her present exemption
from confinement in an exposed, unhealthy cell. How this promise
was to be managed, neither of them had been able to think of.
Keeper Arnold might be approached; but Dulcibel feared not&mdash;at
least under present circumstances. If brought to trial and
convicted then to save her life, Dulcibel thought he might be
persuaded to aid her. As to breaking her word to the Keeper, that
never entered the mind of the truthful maiden, or of her lover.
Death even was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id=
"Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> more endurable than the thought of
dishonor&mdash;if they had thought of the matter at all. But as I
have said, they never even thought of a such thing. And therefore
how to manage the affair was a very perplexing question.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id=

<h4>The First Rattle of the
Rattlesnake.</h4>
<p>One day about this time Master Raymond was
sitting in the porch of the Red Lion, thinking over a sight he had
just seen;&mdash;a man had passed by wearing on the back of his
drab coat a capital I two inches long, cut out of black cloth, and
sewed upon it. On inquiry he found the man had married his deceased
wife's sister; and both he and the woman had been first whipped,
and then condemned to wear this letter for the rest of their lives,
according to the law of the colony.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id=
"FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p>Master Raymond was puzzling over the matter
not being able to make out that any real offence had been
committed, when who should walk up to the porch but Master Joseph
Putnam. After a hearty hand-shaking between the two, they retired
to Master Raymond's apartments.</p>
<p>"Well, how are things getting along at
Salem?"</p>
<p>"Oh, about as usual!"</p>
<p>"Any more accusations?"</p>
<p>"Plenty of them, people are beginning to find
out that the best way to protect themselves is <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>to
sham being 'afflicted,' and accuse somebody else."</p>
<p>"I saw that a good while ago."</p>
<p>"And when a girl or a woman is accused, her
relatives and her friends gather around her, and implore her to
confess, to save her life. For they have found that not one person
who has been accused of being a witch, and has admitted the fact,
has been convicted.</p>
<p>"And yet it would seem that a confession of
witchcraft ought to be a better proof of it, than the mere
assertion of possible enemies," responded Master
Raymond.</p>
<p>"Of course&mdash;if there was any show of
reason or fairness in the prosecutions, from first to last; but as
it is all sheer malice and wickedness, on the part of the accusers,
from the beginning to the end, it would be vain to expect any
reasonableness or fairness from them."</p>
<p>"We must admit, however, that there is some
delusion in it. It would be too uncharitable to believe otherwise,"
said Master Raymond thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"There may have been at the very
first&mdash;on the part of the children," replied Master Putnam.
"They might have supposed that Tituba and friend<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>less
Sarah Good tormented them&mdash;but since then, there has not been
more than one part of delusion to twenty parts of wickedness. Why,
can any sane man suppose that she-wolf sister-in-law of mine does
not know she is lying, when she brings such horrible charges
against the best men and women in Salem?"</p>
<p>"No, I give up Mistress Ann, she is possessed
by a lying devil," admitted Master Raymond.</p>
<p>"It is well she does not hear that speech,"
said Joseph Putnam.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because, up to this time, you seem to have
managed to soften her heart a little."</p>
<p>"I have tried to. I have thought myself
justified in playing a part&mdash;as King David once did you
know."</p>
<p>"It is that which brings me here. I met her
at the house of a friend whom I called to see on some business a
day or two ago."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"She said to me, in that soft purring voice
of hers, 'Brother Joseph, I hear that your good friend Master
Raymond is still in Boston.' I answered that I believed he was.
'When he took leave of me,' she continued, 'I advised
him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg
265]</a></span> not to stay long in that town&mdash;as it was often
a bad climate for strangers. I am sorry he does not take wise
counsel.' Then she passed on, and out of the house. Have you any
idea what she meant?"</p>
<p>Master Raymond studied a moment over it in
silence. Then he said:&mdash;"It is the first warning of the
rattlesnake, I suppose. How many do they usually give before they
spring?"</p>
<p>"Three, the saying goes. But I guess this
rattlesnake cannot be trusted to give more than one."</p>
<p>"I was convinced I saw your brother Thomas as
I came ashore from the Storm King the other day."</p>
<p>"Ah, that explains it then. She understands
it all then. She understands it all now just as well as if you had
told her."</p>
<p>"But why should she pursue so fiendishly an
innocent girl like Dulcibel, who is not conscious of ever having
offended her?"</p>
<p>"Why do tigers slay, and scorpions sting?
Because it is their nature, I suppose," replied Master Putnam
philosophically. "Because, Mistress Dulcibel openly ridiculed and
denounced her and the whole witchcraft business. And you will note
that there has not been a single instance of<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> this
being done, that the circle of accusers have not seemed maddened to
frenzy."</p>
<p>"Yes,&mdash;there has been one
case&mdash;your own."</p>
<p>"That is true&mdash;because I am Thomas
Putnam's brother. And, dupe and tool as he is of that she-wolf, and
though there is no great amount of love lost between us&mdash;still
I am his brother! And that protects me. Besides they know that it
is as much any two men's lives are worth to attempt to arrest
me."</p>
<p>"And then you think there is no special
enmity against Dulcibel?"</p>
<p>"I have not said so. Jethro Sands hates her
because she refused him; Leah Herrick wants her driven away,
because she herself wants to marry Jethro, and fears Jethro might
after all, succeed in getting Dulcibel; and Sister Ann hates her,
because&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, because what?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it seems too egotistical to say
it&mdash;because she knows she is one of my dear
friends."</p>
<p>"She must dislike you very much
then?"</p>
<p>"She does."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Oh, there is no good reason. At the first,
she was inclined to like me&mdash;but I always knew she<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> was
a cold-blooded snake and she-wolf, and I would have nothing to do
with her. Then when brother Thomas began to sink his manhood and
become the mere dupe and tool of a scheming woman, I remonstrated
with him. I think, friend Raymond, that I am as chivalrous as any
man ought to be. I admire a woman in her true place as much as any
man&mdash;and would fight and die for her. But for these men that
forget their manhood, these Marc Antonies who yield up their sound
reason and their manly strength to the wiles and tears and charms
of selfish and ambitious Cleopatras, I have nothing but contempt.
There are plenty of them around in all ages of the world, and they
generally glory in their shame. Of course brother Thomas did not
enjoy very much my mean opinion of his conduct&mdash;and as for
sister Ann, she has never forgiven me, and never will."</p>
<p>"And so you think she hates Dulcibel, mainly
because you love her?"</p>
<p>"That is about the shape of it," said Master
Putnam drily. "That Dulcibel feels for me the affection of a
sister, only intensifies my sister-in-law's aversion to her. But
then, you see, that merely on the general principle of denouncing
all who set themselves in opposition to the so-called<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
afflicted circle, Dulcibel would be accused of
witchcraft."</p>
<p>"Well, for my part, I think the whole affair
can only be accounted for as being a piece of what we men of the
world, who do not belong to any church, call devilishness," said
Master Raymond hotly.</p>
<p>"You see," responded Master Putnam, "that you
men of the world have to come to the same conclusion that we church
members do. You impute it to 'devilishness' and we to being
'possessed by the devil.' It is about the same thing. And now give
me an idea of your latest plans. Perhaps I can forward them in some
way, either here or at Salem."</p>

<h4>Conflicting Currents in Boston.</h4>
<p>All this time the under-current of opposition
to these criminal proceedings against the alleged witches, was
growing stronger, at Boston. The Reverend Samuel Willard and Joshua
Moody both ministers of undoubted orthodoxy from the Puritan
stand-point, did not scruple to visit the accused in the keeping of
jailer Arnold, and sympathize openly with them. Captain Alden and
Master Philip English and his wife especially, were persons of too
great wealth and reputation not to have many sympathizing
friends.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the great majority of the
Puritans, under the lead of the Reverend Cotton Mather, and the two
Salem ministers, Parris and Noyes were determined that the
prosecution should go on, until the witches, those children of the
Evil One, were thoroughly cast out; even if half of their
congregations should have to be hung by the other half.</p>
<p>At a recent trial in Salem, one of the
"afflicted" had even gone so far as to cry out against the Rev.
Master Willard. But the Court, it seemed, was<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> not
quite ready for that; for the girl was sent out of court, being
told that she must have mistaken the person. When this was reported
to Master Willard, it by no means tended to lessen his growing
belief that the prosecutions were inspired by evil
spirits.</p>
<p>Of course in this condition of things, the
position of the Governor, Sir William Phips, became a matter of the
first importance. As he owed his office mainly to the influence of
the Rev. Increase Mather, and sat under the weekly ministrations of
his learned son, Cotton Mather, the witch prosecutors had a very
great hold upon him. With a good natural intellect, Sir William had
received a very scanty education; and was therefore much impressed
by the prodigious attainments of such men as the two Mathers. To
differ with them on a theological matter seemed to him rather
presumptuous. If they did not know what was sound in theology, and
right in practise; why was there any use in having ministers at
all, or who could be expected to be certain of anything?</p>
<p>Then if Sir William turned to the law, he was
met by an almost unanimous array of lawyers and judges who endorsed
the witchcraft prosecution. Chief-Justice Stoughton, honest and
learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg
271]</a></span> Judge Sewall&mdash;and nearly all the rest of the
judiciary&mdash;were sure of the truth in this matter. Not one
magistrate could be found in the whole province, to decide as a
sensible English judge is reported by tradition to have done, in
the case of an old woman who at last acknowledged in the feebleness
of her confused intellect that she was a witch, and in the habit of
riding about on a broomstick: "Well, as I know of no law that
forbids old women riding about on broomsticks, if they fancy that
mode of conveyance, you are discharged." But there was not one
magistrate at that time, wise or learned enough to make such a
sensible decision in the whole of New England.</p>
<p>Thus with the almost unanimous bar, and the
great preponderance of the clergy, advising him to pursue a certain
course, Sir William undoubtedly would have followed it, had he not
been a man whose sympathies naturally were with sea-captains,
military officers, and other men-of-the-world; and, moreover, if he
had not a wife, herself the daughter of a sea-captain, who was an
utter disbeliever in her accused friends being witches, and who had
moreover a very strong will of her own.</p>
<p>Of course if the Governor should come to Lady
Mary's opinion, the prosecution might as well be<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
abandoned&mdash;for, with a stroke of his pen, he could remit the
sentences of all the convicted persons. Left to himself and Lady
Mary, he doubtless would have done this; but he wished to continue
in his office, and to be a successful Governor; and he knew that to
array himself against the prosecution and punishment of the alleged
witches was to displease the great majority of the people of the
province; including, as I have shown, the most influential persons.
In fact, it was simply to retire from his government in
disgrace.</p>
<p>All this the Reverend Cotton Mather
represented to Sir William, with much else of a less worldly, but
no doubt still more effective character, based upon various
passages of the old Testament rather than upon anything
corresponding to them in the New.</p>
<p>And so the prosecutions and convictions went
on; but the further executions waited upon the Governor's
decision.</p>

<h4>The Rattlesnake Makes a Spring.</h4>
It was a Thursday afternoon, and the "afflicted
circle" was having one of its informal meetings at the house of
Mistress Ann Putnam. At these meetings the latest developments were
talked over; and all the scandal of the neighborhood, and even of
Boston and other towns, gathered and discussed. Thus in the
examination of Captain Alden in addition to the material charges of
witchcraft against him, which I have noted, were entirely
irrelevant slanders of the grossest kind against his moral
character which the "afflicted girls" must have gathered from very
low and vulgar sources.<br />
<br />
<p>The only man present on this occasion was
Jethro Sands; and the girls, especially Leah Herrick, could not but
wonder who now was to be "cried out against," that Jethro was
brought into their counsels.</p>
<p>It is a curious natural instinct which leads
every faculty&mdash;even the basest&mdash;to crave more food in
proportion to the extent in which it has been already gratified. In
the first place, the "afflicted" girls no doubt had their little
spites, revenges, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id=
"Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> jealousies to indulge, but
afterwards they seemed to "cry out" against those of whom they
hardly knew anything, either to oblige another of the party, or to
punish for an expressed disbelief in their sincerity, or even out
of the mere wantonness of power to do evil.</p>
<p>Mistress Ann Putnam opened the serious
business of the afternoon, after an hour or so had been spent in
gossip and tale-bearing, by an account of some recent troubles of
hers.</p>
<p>"A few nights ago," said she, "I awakened in
the middle of the night with choking and strangling. I knew at once
that a new 'evil hand' was upon me; for the torment was different
from any I had ever experienced. I thought the hand that grasped me
around the throat would have killed me&mdash;and there was a heavy
weight upon my breast, so that I could hardly breathe. I clutched
at the thing that pressed upon my breast, and it felt hard and bony
like a horse's hoof&mdash;and it was a horse. By the faint
moonlight I saw it was the wild black 'familiar' that belongs to
the snake-marked witch, Dulcibel Burton. But the hand that grasped
my throat was the strong hand of a man. I caught a sight of his
face. I knew it well. But I pity him so much that I hesitate
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg
275]</a></span> reveal it. I feel as if I would almost rather
suffer myself, than accuse so fine a young man as he seemed to be
of such wicked conduct."</p>
<p>"But it appears to me that it is your duty to
expose him, Mistress Putnam," said Jethro Sands. "I know the young
man whose spectre you saw, for he and that black witch of a mare
seem to be making their nightly rounds together. They 'afflicted'
me the other night the same way. I flung them off; and I asked him
what he meant by acting in that way? And he said he was a lover of
the witch Dulcibel; who was one of the queens of Hell&mdash;I might
know that by the snake-mark on her bosom. And she had told him that
he must afflict all those who had testified against her; and she
would lend him her 'familiar,' the black mare, to help him do
it."</p>
<p>By this time, even the dullest of the girls
of course saw very plainly who was being aimed at; but Mistress
Putnam added, "upon learning that Master Jethro had also been
afflicted by this person, I had very little doubt that I should
find the guilty young man had been doing the same to all of you;
for we have seen heretofore that when these witches attack one of
us, they attack all, hating all for the same reason, that we expose
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg
276]</a></span> denounce them. I may add that I have also heard
that the young man in question is now in Boston doing all he can in
aid of the snake-witch Dulcibel Burton; and representing all of us
to Lady Mary Phips and other influential persons, as being
untruthful and malicious accusers of innocent people." Here she
turned to one who had always been her right-hand as it were, and
said:&mdash;"I suppose you have been tormented in the same way,
dear Abigail?"</p>
<p>Ann Putnam, her daughter, however, that
precocious and unmanageable girl of twelve, here broke in: "I think
my mother is entirely mistaken. I was treated just the same way
about a week ago; but it was not the spectre of Master Raymond at
all&mdash;it was the spectre of another man whom I never saw
before. It was not at all like Master Raymond; and I, for one, will
not join in crying out against him."</p>
<p>In those old times, parents were treated with
a much greater show, at least, of respect and veneration than they
are at present; and therefore Mistress Putnam was greatly shocked
at her daughter's language; but her daughter was well known to all
present as an exceptional child, being very forward and
self-willed, and therefore her mother simply<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
said, "I had not expected such unkind behavior from you,
Ann."</p>
<p>"Master Raymond has been very kind to all of
us, you know&mdash;has given us pretty things, and has promised to
send us all presents when he gets back from England; and I have
heard you and father both say, that the Putnams always stand up for
their friends."</p>
<p>This reference to the promised presents from
England, evidently told all around the circle. They had nothing to
gain by "crying out" against Master Raymond, they had something to
gain by not doing it; besides, he was a very handsome young man,
who had tried to make himself agreeable to almost all of them as he
had opportunity. And though Dulcibel's beauty went for nothing in
their eyes, a young man's good looks and gallant bearing were
something entirely different.</p>
<p>And so Abigail Williams, and Mary Walcot, and
Mercy Lewis, and Leah Herrick, and Sarah Churchill, and Elizabeth
Hubbard all had the same tale to tell with suitable variations, as
young Ann Putnam had. They were certain that the face of the
"spectre" was not the face of Master Raymond; but of some person
they had never before seen. Mercy Lewis and Sarah
Churchill,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id=
"Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> in fact, were inclined to think it
was the face of Satan himself; and they all wondered very much that
Mistress Putnam could have mistaken such an old and ugly face, for
that of the comely young Englishman.</p>
<p>As for Leah Herrick, she did not care in her
secret heart if Master Raymond were in love with Dulcibel&mdash;so
that he would only take her out of the country, where there was no
danger of Jethro's seeing her any more. All her belief that
Dulcibel was a witch was based upon jealousy, and now that it was
utterly improbable that Jethro would ever turn his thoughts in that
direction again, she had no hard feeling towards her; while, as she
also had reason to expect a handsome present from England, she did
not share in the least Jethro's bitterness against the young
Englishman.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id=
"Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>But although Mistress Putnam was thus
utterly foiled in her effort to enlist the "afflicted circle" in
her support, she was not the woman to give up her settled purpose
on that account. She knew well that she was a host in herself, so
far as the magistrates were concerned. And, having Jethro Sands to
join her, it made up the two witnesses that were absolutely
necessary by the law of Massachusetts as of Moses. The "afflicted
circle" might not aid her, but it was not likely that they would
openly revolt, and take part against her in public; and so she went
the very next morning in company with that obedient tool, her
husband and Jethro Sands, to the office of Squire Hathorne, and got
him to issue a warrant for the arrest of Master Ellis Raymond, on
the usual charge of practicing witchcraft.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id=

<h4>An Interview with Lady Mary.</h4>
<p>Master Raymond, having obtained an
introduction to the Governor's wife, Lady Mary, lost no time in
endeavoring to "cultivate the amenities of life," so far as that
very influential person was concerned. He had paid the most
deferential court to her on several occasions where he had been
able to meet her socially; and had impressed the Governor's lady
very favorably, as being an unusually handsome, well-bred and
highly cultivated young man. A comely and high-spirited lady of
forty, she was better pleased to be the recipient of the courteous
and deferential attentions of a young Englishman of good
connections like Master Raymond, than even to listen to the wise
and weighty counsel of so learned a man as Master Cotton
Mather.</p>
<p>Only in the last minutes of their last
meeting however, when handing her ladyship to her carriage, did
Master Raymond feel at liberty to ask her if he could have a short
private interview with her the next morning. She looked a little
surprised, and then said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281"
id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> "Of course, Master
Raymond."</p>
<p>"At what hour will it suit your
ladyship?"</p>
<p>"At twelve, precisely, I have an engagement
at one;" and the carriage drove off.</p>
<p>A minute or two before twelve, Master Raymond
was at the Governor's house in Green lane; and was duly admitted,
as one expected, and shown into her ladyship's boudoir.</p>
<p>"Now, come right to the point, Master
Raymond; and tell me what I can do for you," said her ladyship
smiling. "If I can help you, I will; if I cannot, or must not, I
shall say so at once&mdash;and you must continue to be just as good
a friend to me as ever."</p>
<p>"I promise that to your ladyship," replied
the young man earnestly. He really liked and admired Lady Mary very
much.</p>
<p>"Is it love, or money?&mdash;young men always
want one of these."</p>
<p>"Your ladyship is as quick-witted in this as
in everything else."</p>
<p>"Well, which is it?"</p>
<p>"Love."</p>
<p>"Ah&mdash;who?"</p>
<p>"Mistress Dulcibel Burton."</p>
<p>"What!&mdash;not the girl with the
snake-mark?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id=
"Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<p>Raymond bowed his head very low in
answer.</p>
<p>Lady Mary laughed. "She is a witch then, it
seems; for she has bewitched you."</p>
<p>"We were betrothed to each other only a few
days before that absurd and lying charge was made against
her."</p>
<p>"And her horse&mdash;her black
mare&mdash;that upset the Reverend Master Parris into the duck
pond; and then went up into the clouds; and, as Master Cotton
Mather solemnly assured me, has never been seen or heard of
since&mdash;what of it&mdash;where is it, really?"</p>
<p>"In an out-of-the-way place, up in Master
Joseph Putnam's woods," replied the young man smiling.</p>
<p>"And you are certain of it?"</p>
<p>"As certain as riding the mare for about ten
miles will warrant."</p>
<p>"Master Mather assured me that no
man&mdash;except perhaps Satan or one of his imps&mdash;could ride
her."</p>
<p>"Then I must be Satan or one of his imps, I
suppose."</p>
<p>"How did you manage it?"</p>
<p>"I put a side-saddle on the beast; and a
woman's skirt on myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283"
id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<p>The lady laughed outright. "Oh, that is too
good! It reminds me of what Sir William often says, 'Anything can
be done, if you know how to do it!' I must tell it to him he will
enjoy it so much. And it will be a good thing to plague Master
Mather with."</p>
<p>"Please do not tell anyone just now,"
protested the young man earnestly. "It may bring my good friend,
Joseph Putnam, into trouble. And it would only make them all
angrier than they are with Dulcibel."</p>
<p>"Dulcibel&mdash;that is a strange name. It is
Italian&mdash;is it not."</p>
<p>"I judge so. It is a family name. I suppose
there is Italian blood in the family. At least Mistress Dulcibel
looks it."</p>
<p>"She does. She is very beautiful&mdash;of a
kind of strange, fascinating beauty. I do not wonder she bewitched
you. Was that serpent mark too from Italy?"</p>
<p>"I think it very likely."</p>
<p>"Perhaps she is descended from
Cleopatra&mdash;and that is the mark left by the serpent on the
famous queen's breast."</p>
<p>"I think it exceedingly probable," said
Master Raymond. My readers will have observed before<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
this, that he was an exceedingly polite and politic young
man.</p>
<p>"Well, and so you want me to get Mistress
Dulcibel, this witch descendant of that famous old witch,
Cleopatra, out of prison?"</p>
<p>"I hoped that, from the well-known kindness
of heart of your ladyship, you would be able to do something for
us."</p>
<p>"You see the difficulty is simply here. I
know that all these charges of witchcraft against such good, nice
people as Captain Alden, Master and Mistress English, your
betrothed Dulcibel, and a hundred others, are mere bigotry and
superstition at the best, and sheer spite and maliciousness at the
worst&mdash;but what can I do? Sir William owes his position to the
Reverend Increase Mather&mdash;and, besides, not being a greatly
learned man himself, is more impressed than he ought to be by the
learning of the ministers and the lawyers. I tell him that a
learned fool is the greatest fool alive; but still he is much
puzzled. If he does not conform to the wishes of the ministers and
the judges, who are able to lead the great majority of the people
in any direction they choose, he will lose his position as
Governor. Now, while this is not so much in itself, it will be a
bar to his future<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id=
"Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> advancement&mdash;for preferment
does not often seek the men who fail, even when they fail from
having superior wisdom and nobleness to the multitude."</p>
<p>It was evident that Sir William and Lady Mary
had talked over this witchcraft matter, and its bearing upon his
position, a good many times. And Master Raymond saw very clearly
the difficulties of the case.</p>
<p>"And still, if the robe of the Governor can
only continue to be worn by dyeing it with innocent blood, I think
that a man of the natural greatness and nobility of Sir William,
would not hesitate as to his decision."</p>
<p>"But a new Governor in his place might do
worse."</p>
<p>"Yes, he might easily do that."</p>
<p>"When it comes to taking more lives by his
order, then he will decide upon his course. So far he is
temporizing," said the lady.</p>
<p>"And Dulcibel?"</p>
<p>"She is not suffering," was the reply. "Oh,
if I only could say the same of the poor old women, and poor young
women, now lying in those cold and loathsome cells&mdash;innocent
of any crime whatever either against God or against man&mdash;I
should not feel it all here so heavily," and Lady<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> Mary
pressed her hand against her heart. "But we are not responsible for
it! I have taken off every chain&mdash;and do all I dare; while Sir
William shuts his eyes to my unlawful doings."</p>
<p>"Will you aid her to escape, should her life
be in danger? You told me to speak out frankly and to the
point."</p>
<p>The lady hesitated only for a moment. "I will
do all I can&mdash;even to putting my own life in peril. When
something <i>must</i> be done, come to me again. And now judge me
and Sir William kindly; knowing that we are not despots, but
compelled to rule somewhat in accordance with the desires of those
whom we have been sent here to govern."</p>
<p>Lady Mary extended her hand; the young man
took it, as he might have taken the hand of his sovereign Queen,
and pressed it with his lips. Then he bowed himself out of the
boudoir.</p>

<h4>Master Raymond is Arrested for
Witchcraft.</h4>
<p>As Master Raymond walked up the street toward
the Red Lion, he felt in better spirits. He had secured the aid, if
things should come to the worst of a very influential
friend&mdash;and one who, woman-like, would be apt to go even
farther than her word, as noble spirits in such cases are apt to
do. Therefore he was comparatively light-hearted.</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt a strong grasp upon his
shoulder; and turning, he saw a couple of men beside him. One he
knew well as deputy-marshall Herrick, of Salem.</p>
<p>"You are wanted at Salem, Master Raymond,"
said Marshall Herrick gravely, producing a paper.</p>
<p>Raymond felt a sinking of heart as he glanced
over it&mdash;it was the warrant for his arrest, issued by Squire
Hathorne.</p>
<p>"At whose complaint?" he asked, controlling
his emotions, and speaking quite calmly and pleasantly.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg
288]</a></span></p>
<p>"At the complaint of Mistress Ann Putnam and
Master Jethro Sands," replied the officer.</p>
<p>"Of witchcraft? That is very curious. For as
Dr. Griggs knows, just before I left Salem Farms, I was suffering
from 'an evil hand' myself."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" said the officer.</p>
<p>"When am I to go?"</p>
<p>"Immediately. We have provided a horse for
you."</p>
<p>"I should like to get my valise, and some
clothes from the Red Lion."</p>
<p>The officer hesitated.</p>
<p>Master Raymond smiled pleasantly. "You must
be hungry about this time of day, and they have some of the best
wine at the Lion I ever tasted. You shall drink a bottle or two
with me. You know that a man travels all the better for a good
dinner and a bottle of good wine."</p>
<p>The officers hesitated no longer. "You are a
sensible man, Master Raymond, whether you are a witch or not," said
the deputy marshall.</p>
<p>"I think if the wine were better and plentier
around Salem, there would be fewer witches," rejoined Master
Raymond; which the other officer considered a very witty remark,
judging by the way he laughed at it.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>
<p>The result of this strategic movement of
Master Raymond's, was that he had a couple of very pleasant and
good-humored officials to attend him all the way to Salem jail,
where they arrived in the course of the evening. Proving that thus
by the aid of a little metaphorical oil and sugar, even official
machinery could be made to work a good deal smoother than it
otherwise would. While the officers themselves expressed their
utter disbelief to the people they met, of the truth of the charges
that had been brought against Master Raymond; who in truth was
himself "an afflicted person," and had been suffering some time
from an "evil hand," as the wise Dr. Griggs had
declared.</p>
<p>The Salem keeper, Uncle Robie, true to his
accustomed plan of action, received Master Raymond very gruffly;
but after he had got rid of the other professionals, he had a good
long talk, and made his cell quite comfortable for him. He also
took him in to visit Antipas, who was delighted to see him, and
also to hear that Mistress Dulcibel, was quite comfortably lodged
with Keeper Arnold.</p>
<p>Then the young man threw himself upon his
bed, and slept soundly till morning. He did not need much study to
decide upon his plans, as he<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> had contemplated such
a possibility as that, ever since the arrest of Dulcibel, and had
fully made up his mind in what manner he would meet it. If,
however, he had known the results of the conference of the
"afflicted circle" two days previous, he would have felt more
encouraged as to the probable success of the defence he meditated.
The constable that had aided the deputy-marshall in making the
arrest, had agreed however to send word to Joseph Putnam of what
had occurred; and comforted by the thought of having at least one
staunch friend to stand by him, Master Raymond had slept soundly
even on a prison pallet.</p>
<p>The next morning, as early as the rules of
the jail would admit, Joseph Putnam came to see him. "I had
intended to come and see you in Boston to-day," said Master Joseph,
"but the she-wolf was too quick for me."</p>
<p>"Why, had you heard anything?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and I hardly understand it. Abigail
Williams called to see Goodwife Buckley yesterday, and told her in
confidence that it was probable you would be cried out against by
Sister Ann and Jethro Sands; and to warn me of it."</p>
<p>"Abigail Williams!"</p>
<p>"Yes; and she also dropped a hint that none
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg
291]</a></span> the other 'afflicted girls' had anything to do with
it&mdash;for they looked upon you as a very nice young man, and a
friend."</p>
<p>"Well, that is good news indeed," said Master
Raymond brightening up.</p>
<p>"And I called upon Doctor Griggs on my way
here, and he says he is confident there was an 'evil hand' upon you
when you were suffering at my house; and he will be on hand at the
examination to give his testimony, if it is needed, to that
effect."</p>
<p>"But that terrible sister-in-law of yours! If
she could only be kept away from the examination for half-an-hour;
and give me time to impress the magistrates and the people a
little."</p>
<p>"It might be done perhaps," said Joseph
Putnam musing.</p>
<p>"Do not be too conscientious about the means,
my dear friend," continued Master Raymond. "Do not stand so
straight that you lean backward. Remember that this is war and a
just war against false witnesses, the shedders of innocent blood,
and wicked or deceived rulers. If I am imprisoned, what is to
become of Dulcibel? Think of her&mdash;do not think of
me."</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam was greatly agitated. "I
will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg
292]</a></span> do all I can for both of you. But my soul recoils
from anything like deceit, as from wickedness itself. But I will
think over it, and see if I cannot devise some way to keep Sister
Ann away, for a time or altogether."</p>
<p>"Give me at least fifteen minutes to work on
the Magistrates, and to enlist the sympathies of the people in my
behalf. For me, so far as my conscience is concerned, I should not
hesitate to shoot that Jezebel. For the murder of the twenty
innocent men and women who have now been put to death, she is
mainly responsible. And to kill her who surely deserves to die,
might save the lives of fifty others."</p>
<p>Joseph Putnam shook his head. "I cannot see
the matter in that light, Friend Raymond."</p>
<p>"Oh," replied Raymond, "of course I do not
mean you should kill Mistress Ann. I only put it as giving my idea
of how far <i>my</i> conscience would allow me to go in the matter.
Draw her off in some way though&mdash;keep her out of the room for
awhile&mdash;give me a little time to work in."</p>
<p>"I will do all I can; you may be sure of
that," responded Master Putnam emphatically.</p>
<p>Here further confidential conversation was
prevented by the entrance of the marshall.</p>

<h4>Master Raymond Astonishes the
Magistrates.</h4>
<p>The examination was to commence at three
o'clock in the afternoon, and to be held in the Court House in the
town, as being more convenient to Squire Hathorne than the
meeting-house in the village.</p>
<p>As Master Thomas Putnam's house and farm were
several miles beyond the village, it made quite a long ride for
them to attend the examination. He had arranged with his wife,
however, to start immediately after their usual twelve o'clock
dinner, taking her behind him on a pillion, as was customary at
that day&mdash;his daughter Ann being already in town, where she
was paying a visit to a friend. He had received however a message
about ten o'clock, requesting his immediate presence at Ipswich, on
a matter of the most urgent importance; and though he was greatly
puzzled by it, he concluded to go at once to Ipswich and go from
there direct to Salem town, without coming home again, as it would
be very much out of his road to do so.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg
294]</a></span></p>
<p>According to this new arrangement, Mistress
Ann would take the other horse, and a lady's saddle, and ride to
town by herself. They had still a third horse, but that was already
in town with her daughter.</p>
<p>The Court House was but a short distance from
the prison; and, as it was a good Puritan fashion to be punctual to
the minute, at three o'clock precisely Squires Hathorne and Corwin
were in their arm-chairs, and Master Raymond standing on the raised
platform in front of them. As the latter looked carefully around
the room, he saw that neither Thomas Putnam nor his mischievous
wife, nor his own best friend Joseph Putnam, was present. Squire
Hathorne also observed that Mistress Ann Putnam was not present;
but, as she was usually very punctual, he concluded that she would
be there in a few minutes, and after some whispered words with his
colleague, resolved to proceed with the examination.</p>
<p>Turning to the young Englishman, he said in
his usual stern tones:&mdash;"Ellis Raymond, you are brought before
authority, upon high suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft. Now
tell us the truth of this matter."</p>
<p>But no answer came from the accused.
Then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg
295]</a></span> when all eyes were intently regarding him, he gave
a wild shriek, and fell outstretched upon the platform.</p>
<p>"Let me to him!" said Dr. Griggs, elbowing
his way through the crowd. "I said a month ago that an 'evil hand'
was upon him; and now I am certain of it."</p>
<p>Master Raymond had not been an attentive
observer of the recent trials for nothing; and he now gave the
audience an exhibition which would compare favorably with the best,
even with Mistress Ann Putnam's and Abigail William's. His face
became shockingly contorted, and he writhed and twisted and turned
convulsively. He tore imaginary spectral hands from around his
neck. He pushed imaginary weights from off his breast. He cried,
"Take them away! Pray, take them away!" until the whole company
were very much affected; and even the magistrates were greatly
astounded.</p>
<p>Dr. Griggs loosened his collar and unbuttoned
his doublet, and had water brought to sprinkle his face keeping up
a running fire of words at the same time, to the effect that he
knew, and had said, as least a month before, that Master Raymond
had an "evil hand" upon him.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>
<p>"Who is it hurts you?" at length asked
credulous Squire Hathorne.</p>
<p>"See, there is the yellow bird!" cried the
young man, staring into vacancy. "He is coming to peck my eyes out!
Kill it! kill it!" dashing his hands out from his face violently.
"Has no one a sword&mdash;pray do try to kill it!"</p>
<p>Here an impetuous young villager, standing
by, drew his rapier, and stabbed violently in the direction of the
supposed spectral bird.</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! You almost killed it! See, there are
some of its feathers!" And three yellow feathers were seen floating
in the air; being small chicken feathers with which he had been
provided that very morning by Uncle Robie, the jailer; and which
the adroit Master Raymond rightly thought would have a prodigious
effect.</p>
<p>And the result was fully equal to his
expectations. From that moment, it was evident that he had all the
beholders with him; and Squire Hathorne, disposed as he had been to
condemn him almost without a hearing, was completely staggered. He
had the feathers from the "yellow bird" carefully placed upon his
desk, with the purpose of transmitting them at once to Master
Cotton Mather who, with these palpable proofs of the reality of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg
297]</a></span> spectral appearance would be able utterly to
demolish all the skeptical unbelievers.</p>
<p>Finding that such an effect had been
produced, Master Raymond allowed himself to regain his composure
somewhat.</p>
<p>"Mistress Ann Putnam, who is one of the two
complainants, unaccountably is not here," said Squire Hathorne.
"Master Jethro Sands, what have you to say against this young man?
You are the other complainant."</p>
<p>"Probably my mother has come to the
conclusion that she was mistaken, as I told her; and therefore she
has remained at home," said Ann Putnam, the daughter; who was
delighted with the feather exhibition, and was secretly wondering
how it was done.</p>
<p>"Well, what have you to say,&mdash;Jethro
Sands?"</p>
<p>The audience looked around at Jethro with
scornful faces, evidently considering him an imposter. What did he
know about witches&mdash;compared to this rich young man from over
the seas?</p>
<p>"Tell him you find you were mistaken also,"
whispered Leah Herrick.</p>
<p>"After seeing what we have seen, I withdraw
my charges, Squire. I think that Mistress Put<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>nam
and myself must have been visited by the spectre of somebody else,
and not by Master Raymond."</p>
<p>"I hope that next time you will wait until
you are quite certain," replied Squire Hathorne gruffly. "Do you
know that Master Raymond can have his action against you for very
heavy damages, for slander and defamation?"</p>
<p>"I certainly am very sorry, and humbly beg
Master Raymond's pardon," said Jethro, very much alarmed. He had
never thought that the affair might take this turn&mdash;as indeed
it did in many cases, some six months afterward; and which was a
very effective damper upon the spirits of the
prosecutors.</p>
<p>Then the magistrates could do nothing less
than discharge the prisoner; and Master Raymond stepped down from
the platform a free man, to be surrounded by quite a circle of
sympathizing friends. But his first thanks were due to Dr. Griggs
for his professional services.</p>
<p>"Doctor, those things you did for me when in
the convulsions, relieved me greatly," and he took out his purse.
"Yes, Doctor, I insist upon it. Skill like yours is always worth
its recompense. We must not muzzle the ox, you know,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> that
treads out the corn." And he put a gold piece into Dr. Grigg's
palm&mdash;which was not often favored with anything but silver in
Salem.</p>
<p>Dr. Griggs was glad that he had been able to
render him a little service; and said that, if there had been the
least necessity for it, he would have gone on the platform, and
testified as to the complete absurdity of the charge that that
excellent woman, Mistress Ann Putnam, evidently in mistake, had
brought against him.</p>
<p>Then the "afflicted circle" had to be spoken
to, who this afternoon did not appear to be in the least afflicted,
but in the very best of spirits. They now felt more admiration for
him than ever; and greeted him with great cordiality as he came to
where they were standing. "When are you going back to England?" was
a frequent question; and he assured them he now hoped to go before
many weeks; and then, smiling, added that they would be certain to
hear from him.</p>
<p>As the crowd thinned out a little, Abigail
Williams called him aside; "and did you really see the yellow bird,
Master Raymond?" said she archly.</p>
<p>"The yellow bird!" replied he dreamily. "Ah!
you know that when we that are 'afflicted'<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> go
into trances, we are not conscious of all that we see."</p>
<p>"For it seemed to me," continued the girl in
a low tone, "that those feathers looked very much like chicken
feathers." Then she laughed cunningly, and peered into his
face.</p>
<p>"Indeed!" replied the young man gravely;
"well, a chicken's bill, pecking at your eyes, is not a thing to be
made light of. I knew of a girl, one of whose eyes was put entirely
out by her pet canary."</p>
<p>And as he moved at once toward the rest of
the group, the quick-witted and precocious child was compelled to
follow.</p>
<p>The magistrates had left the Court House,
with the majority of the people, including Jethro Sands, when who
should come in, walking hastily, and his face flushed with hard
riding, but Thomas Putnam.</p>
<p>"Am I too late? What was done?" he said
quickly to Leah Herrick, who was standing near the door.</p>
<p>"Oh, the charge broke down, and Master
Raymond was discharged."</p>
<p>"Ah! Where is my wife?"</p>
<p>"She did not come. It was said by your
daugh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg
301]</a></span>ter, that she probably found she was mistaken in the
person, and stayed for that reason."</p>
<p>"I do not believe it&mdash;she would have
told me. What did Jethro Sands do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he withdrew the charges, so far as he
was concerned. There was a great deal more danger that Master
Raymond would prove him to be a witch, than he Master
Raymond."</p>
<p>"I see&mdash;it is a case of conspiracy!"
exclaimed Master Putnam hotly. "Had you any hand in this, Master
Raymond?" turning to the young Englishman, who had drawn near, on
his way to the door.</p>
<p>"Ah, Master Putnam, glad to see you. You did
get here early enough however to witness my triumphant vindication.
Here is learned Dr. Griggs, and young Mistress Williams, and your
own gifted daughter, and handsome Mistress Herrick, and
half-a-dozen others of my old friends who were ready to testify in
my behalf, if any testimony had been needed. Make my compliments to
Mistress Putnam; and give her my best thanks for her noble course,
in confessing by her absence that she was mistaken, and that she
had accused the wrong person."</p>
<p>The cool assurance with which this was
uttered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg
302]</a></span> quite confused Thomas Putnam. Could his wife have
stayed away purposely? Perhaps so, for she was accustomed to rapid
changes of her plans. But why then had he been lured off on a
wild-goose chase all the way to Ipswich?</p>
<p>While he was standing there musing, his
daughter came up. "I think, father, you and mother, next time, had
better take my advice," said that incorrigible and unmanageable
young lady; just about as opposite a character to the usual child
of that period as could well be imagined. But these witchcraft
trials, in which she figured so prominently had utterly demoralized
her in this as in certain other respects.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id=
"Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
<h4>Why Thomas Putnam Went to
Ipswich.</h4>
<p>What young Master Joseph Putnam undertook to
do, he was apt to do pretty thoroughly. When he had once made up
his mind to keep both his brother's wife and his brother himself,
away from the examination, he had rapidly thought over various
plans, and adopted two which he felt pretty certain would not fail.
They all involved a little deceit, or at least double
dealing&mdash;and he hated both those things with a righteous
hatred&mdash;but it was to prevent a great injustice, and perhaps
to save life.</p>
<p>As he rode rapidly homeward, turning over
various plans, in his mind, he had passed through the village, when
he saw some one approaching on what seemed to be the skeleton of an
old horse. He at once recognized the rider as an odd character, a
carpenter, whom he at one time had occasion to employ in doing some
work on a small property he owned in Ipswich. Reining up his horse,
Master Putnam stopped to have a chat with the man&mdash;whose
oddity mainly consisted in his taciturnity, which was broken only
by brief and pithy sentences.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>
<p>"A fine day Ezekiel&mdash;how are things in
Ipswich?"</p>
<p>"Grunty!"</p>
<p>"Ah! I am sorry to hear it. Why, what is the
matter?"</p>
<p>"Broomsticks, chiefly."</p>
<p>"You mean the witches. That is a bad
business. But how shall we mend it?"</p>
<p>The old carpenter was too shrewd to commit
himself. He glanced at Master Putnam, and then turning his head
aside, and giving a little laugh, said, "Burn all the
broomsticks."</p>
<p>"A good idea," replied Master Putnam, also
laughing. "Oh, by the way, Ezekiel, I wonder if you could do a
little errand for me?" and the young man took out his purse and
began opening it. "You are not in a great hurry, are
you?"</p>
<p>"Hurry, is for fools!"</p>
<p>"You know where my brother Thomas lives? Up
this road?" They were just where two roads joined, one leading by
his own house, and the other past his brother's.</p>
<p>"I wish I knew the road to heaven as
well."</p>
<p>"You know how to keep silent, and how to talk
also, Ezekiel&mdash;especially when you are well paid for
it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg
305]</a></span></p>
<p>The old man laughed. "A little bullet
sometimes makes a big hole," he said.</p>
<p>"I want you to go to my brother Thomas, and
say simply these words:&mdash;Ipswich Crown and Anchor. Very
important indeed. At once. Wait till he comes."</p>
<p>"All right." And he held out his hand, into
which Master Joseph put as much silver as the old man could make in
a whole week's work.</p>
<p>"You are not to remember who sent you, or
anything else than those words. Perhaps you have been drinking
rather too much cider, you know. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>The old man's face assumed at once a very
dull and vacant expression, and he said in that impressive manner
which rather too many glasses is apt to give, "Ipswich. Crown and
Anchor. Very important indeed. At once. Wait till he
comes."</p>
<p>"That will do very well, Ezekiel. But not a
word more, mind!"</p>
<p>"Tight as a rat-trap," replied the old
man&mdash;and he turned his skeleton's head, and went up the road
towards Thomas Putnam's.</p>
<p>Joseph felt certain that this would take his
brother to Ipswich. Both of them were greatly interested in a
lawsuit with certain of the Ipswich<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> people, regarding the
northern boundary of the Putnam farms. Thomas was managing the
matter for the family; and was continually on the look-out for
fresh evidence to support the Putnam claim. In fact, bright Master
Raymond had once said that, between the Salem witches and the
Ips-witches, Master Thomas seemed to have no peace of his life. But
this was before the witch persecutions had assumed such a tragical
aspect.</p>
<p>When Ezekiel had found Thomas Putnam and
delivered his brief message, without dismounting from his skeleton
steed, Master Putnam asked at once who sent the message.</p>
<p>"Ipswich. Crown and Anchor. Very important
indeed! At once. Wait till he comes," repeated the old man, with a
face of the most impassive solemnity, and emphasizing every
sentence with his long fore-finger.</p>
<p>And that was all Master Thomas could get out
of him. That much came just as often as he wished it; but no
more&mdash;not a word.</p>
<p>Mistress Ann Putnam had come out to the gate
by that time. "He has been drinking too much cider," she
said.</p>
<p>This gave a suggestion to Ezekiel.</p>
<p>"Yes, too much cider. Rum&mdash;steady
me!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg
307]</a></span></p>
<p>Mistress Putnam thought that it might produce
an effect of that kind, and, going back into the house, soon
reappeared with a rather stiff drink of West India rum; which the
old man tossed off with no perceptible difficulty.</p>
<p>He smiled as he handed back the tin cup which
had held it. "Yes&mdash;steady now!" he said.</p>
<p>"Who gave you the message?" again asked
Master Putnam.</p>
<p>Ezekiel looked solemn and thoughtful. "Who
gave 'im the message," replied Ezekiel slowly.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;who sent you to me?"</p>
<p>"Who sent yer&mdash;to&mdash;me?" again
repeated Ezekiel. "Ipswich. Crown and Anchor. At once. Wait till he
comes." Then the old man's countenance cleared up, as if everything
now must be perfectly satisfactory.</p>
<p>"Oh there is no use in trying to get any more
out of him&mdash;he is too much fuddled," said Mistress Putnam
impatiently.</p>
<p>"More rum&mdash;steady me!" mumbled
Ezekiel.</p>
<p>"No, not a drop more," said Thomas Putnam
peremptorily. "You have had too much already."</p>
<p>The old man frowned&mdash;and turning the
skeleton steed after considerable effort, he gave his
parting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg
308]</a></span> shot&mdash;"Crown and anchor&mdash;wait till he
comes!" and rode off in a spasmodic trot down the lane.</p>
<p>"I shall have to go to Ipswich, and see about
this, it may supply the missing link in our chain of
evidence!"</p>
<p>"But how about this afternoon?" queried his
wife.</p>
<p>"Oh, I can get to Salem by three o'clock, by
fast riding. I will leave the roan horse for you."</p>
<p>"Saddle the grey mare,
Jehosaphat."</p>
<p>And thus it was that his brother Joseph,
looking out of his sitting-room window, about an hour after his
arrival at home, saw Master Thomas Putnam, on his well-known grey
mare, riding along the road past his house on the most direct route
to Ipswich.</p>
<p>"He is out of the way, for one&mdash;if he
waits an hour or two for any person to meet him on important
business at the Crown and Anchor," thought the young man. "It is
important indeed though that he should go, and keep himself out of
mischief; and from helping to take any more innocent lives. And
when he comes to his senses&mdash;in the next world, if not in
this&mdash;he will thank me for deceiving him. Now let me see
whether I can do as good a turn for that delectable wife of
his."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id=

<h4>How Master Joseph Circumvented Mistress
Ann.</h4>
<p>About an hour afterwards, Master Joseph saw
one of his farm-hands coming over the fields from the direction of
his brother's house, which was about two miles almost directly to
the west of his own house. Going out to meet him, he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, Simon Peter, I see that you got the
rake."</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Joseph; but they wish me to
return it as soon as we can."</p>
<p>"That is right. Finish your job in the garden
this afternoon, and take it back early tomorrow morning. You can go
to work now."</p>
<p>The man walked off toward the
garden.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment!" his master cried. The man
stopped. "Anything new at brother Thomas's? Are they all at
home?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed! Master Thomas has gone off to
Ipswich&mdash;and little Ann is at Salem town."</p>
<p>"I could not borrow a horse, then, of them,
you think?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed, sir. There is only one left in
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg
310]</a></span> stable; and Mistress Putnam means to use that to go
to the trial this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, I do not care much;" and his
master walked off to the house, while Simon Peter went to his
work.</p>
<p>Then, after a somewhat earlier dinner than
usual, Master Joseph ordered his young horse, Sweetbriar, saddled;
and after kissing his wife "in a scandalous manner"&mdash;that is,
out of doors, where some one might have seen him do it&mdash;he
mounted, and cantered off down the lane.</p>
<p>The young man loved a good horse and he
claimed that Sweetbriar, with a year or two more of age and
hardening, would be the fastest horse in the Province. As to
temper, the horse was well named; for he could be as sweet, when
properly handled, as a rose; and as sharp and briary as any
rose-stalk under contrary conditions. A nervous, sensitive,
high-mettled animal; Mistress Putnam, though a good rider, said it
was too much work to manage him. While her husband always responded
that Sweetbriar could be ridden by any one, for he was as gentle as
a lamb.</p>
<p>Just as Mistress Ann Putnam had got through
her dinner, she saw her brother-in-law Joseph riding up the lane.
The brothers, as has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311"
id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> seen, differed very widely
relative to the Witchcraft prosecutions; but still they visited one
another, as they were held together by various family ties, and
especially by the old lawsuit against certain of the Ipswich men,
to which I have alluded.</p>
<p>Therefore Mistress Putnam opened the door and
went out to the garden gate, where by this time the young man had
dismounted, and fastened his horse.</p>
<p>"Is brother Thomas at home, Sister
Ann?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;he had a call to Ipswich this
morning."</p>
<p>"Ah&mdash;the lawsuit business."</p>
<p>"I suppose so. But the messenger was so
overcome with liquor, that he could not even remember who sent
him."</p>
<p>"Why, how could Thomas know where to go
then?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the man managed to say that his employee
would be waiting for Thomas at the "Crown and Anchor," where he
usually stops you know."</p>
<p>"Well, I am glad that Thomas went. I stopped
to see if Jehosaphat could do a little errand for me&mdash;I might
have sent one of my own men, but I forget matters
sometimes."</p>
<p>"You will find him at the barn," replied
Mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg
312]</a></span></p>
<p>Putnam, a little anxious to cut short the
conversation, as she wished to get ready for her ride to
Salem.</p>
<p>Going to the barn, Master Joseph soon found
Jehosaphat. "How do, Fatty!" this was the not very dignified
diminutive into which Jehosaphat had dwindled in common use. "How
are you getting along?"</p>
<p>"Fair to middlin, sir. Not as well though as
on the old place, Master Joseph."</p>
<p>"I do not want to interfere with my brother,
remember; but if at any time he should not want you any more,
remember the old place is still open for you. It was your own
fault, you know, that you went."</p>
<p>"I did not know when I was well off, Master
Joseph. I was a fool, that was all."</p>
<p>"I thought so," replied Master Joseph
pithily. "But no matter about that now&mdash;can you do an errand
for me?"</p>
<p>"Of course I can&mdash;the mistress
willing."</p>
<p>"Well, I said I wished to send you on an
errand, and she told me where to find you."</p>
<p>"That is all right then."</p>
<p>"Go to Goodman Buckley's, in Salem village,
and ask him for a bundle I left&mdash;bring it to my<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
house, you know, you can take the roan horse there. And, by the
way, Fatty, if you want to stop an hour or two to see the widow
Jones's pretty daughter, I guess no great harm will be
done."</p>
<p>Jehosaphat giggled&mdash;but then his face
clouded. "But Mistress Putnam wants to take the roan herself this
afternoon. The trial comes off, you know."</p>
<p>"Oh, it is not a trial&mdash;it is only an
examination. And it is all fiddlesticks, anyhow. My sister-in-law
is ruining her health by all this witch business. But if she
insists upon going, I will lend her one of my horses. Therefore
that need not keep you."</p>
<p>So Jehosaphat, in high glee at having an
afternoon's holiday, with the roan horse, threw on the saddle and
mounted.</p>
<p>As he rode at a rapid canter down the lane,
Mistress Ann heard the noise, but supposed it was Master Joseph
riding off again,&mdash;and did not even trouble herself to look
out of the window, especially as she was just then changing her
gown.</p>
<p>Not long after, coming into the family room,
who should she see there, sitting demurely, reading one of the
Reverend Cotton Mather's most popular sermons, but the same Master
Joseph Putnam whom she had thought she was well rid of.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg
314]</a></span></p>
<p>"I thought you had gone. I surely heard you
riding down the lane," she said in a surprised tone.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I wanted to speak with you about
something."</p>
<p>"Who was it then?&mdash;I surely heard some
one."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it was one of those spectral horses,
with a spectral rider. As Master Mather says: These are very
wonderful and appalling times!" And the young man laughed a little
scornfully.</p>
<p>"Brother Joseph, I do not care to talk with
you upon this question. I greatly regret, as do your brothers and
your uncles, that you have gone over to the infidels and the
scoffers."</p>
<p>"And I regret that they are making such fools
of themselves," replied Joseph hotly.</p>
<p>"I have no time to discuss this question,
brother Joseph," said Mistress Ann with dignity. "I am going to
Salem town this afternoon, very much in the cross, to give my
testimony against a young friend of yours. Would that I could have
been spared this trial!" and his sister-in-law looked up to the
ceiling sanctimoniously. As Joseph told his young wife that night,
her hypocrisy hardened his heart against her; so that he could have
kept her at home by sheer force, if it were necessary,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> and
at all expedient&mdash;in fact he would have preferred that rough
but sincere way.</p>
<p>"If you testify to anything that throws doubt
upon Master Raymond's perfect innocency and goodness, you will
testify to a lie," replied Master Joseph severely.</p>
<p>"As I said, I have no time for argument. Will
you be good enough to tell Jehosaphat to saddle the roan for
me."</p>
<p>"You know that I had your permission to send
Fatty off on an errand&mdash;and he is not back yet."</p>
<p>Mistress Putnam started and bit her lip. She
had made a mistake. "I suppose he will be back before
long."</p>
<p>"I doubt it. I sent him to the
village."</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose I can put on the saddle
myself. Your conscience probably would not allow you to do
it&mdash;even if common courtesy towards a woman, and that woman
your sister, demanded it."</p>
<p>"Without deciding the latter point, I should
think it almost impossible for me to put a saddle on the roan just
now."</p>
<p>"Why? I do not understand you."</p>
<p>"Because he is doubtless miles away by this
time."</p>
<p>"Jehosaphat did not take the
horse!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg
316]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is precisely what he did do."</p>
<p>"He knew I wanted the roan to ride to Salem
town this afternoon."</p>
<p>"He told me you did; but I said that I
thought you would have too much sense to go. Still, if you would
go, that I would lend you one of my horses."</p>
<p>"Well, where is your horse?"</p>
<p>"There, at the door. You can take off my
saddle, and put on your side-saddle, and, if you are in a hurry,
Sweetbriar can do the distance in half the time that the roan
could."</p>
<p>Mistress Putnam could have cried with anger
and vexation. Like many people of strong and resolute will, she was
a good deal of a coward on horseback; and she knew that Sweetbriar
was what the farmers called "a young and very skittish animal."
Still her determined spirit rose against thus being outdone;
besides, she knew well that in a case like this, where none of the
"afflicted circle," not even her own daughter, would aid her, the
whole thing might fall through if she were not present. So she
said, "Well, I will saddle your horse myself."</p>
<p>Here Master Joseph relented&mdash;because he
now felt certain of his game. "I have conscientious<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
scruples against lifting even my little finger to aid you in this
unholy business," he said more placidly, "but under the
circumstances, I will saddle Sweetbriar for you."</p>
<p>So saying, he took off his saddle from the
horse, and substituted the side-saddle which he brought from the
barn. Then he led Sweetbriar to the horse-block, and his
sister-in-law mounted.</p>
<p>She glanced at his spurs. "You ride him with
spurs, I see. Hand me my riding-whip," she said, pointing to where
she had laid it, when she first came out.</p>
<p>"I would not strike him, if I were you. He is
not used to the whip&mdash;it might make him
troublesome."</p>
<p>Mistress Putnam made no reply; but gathered
up the reins, and the horse started down the lane.</p>
<p>A singular smile came across the young man's
features. He went back and closed the door of the house, and then
started in a rapid walk across the field towards his own home.
Neither of them thought it mattered that the house was left for a
time unprotected. Mistress Putnam knew that a couple of farm-hands
were at work in a distant field, who would be back at sundown; and
there were so few strollers at that time, that no
farmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg
318]</a></span> thought of bolting up his doors and windows when he
went to meeting, or to see a neighbor.</p>
<p>The way home across the fields was a good
deal nearer than to go by the road, as the latter made quite an
angle. And, as the young man strode swiftly, on he could see in
many places his sister-in-law, riding deliberately along, and
approaching the forks of the road, where anyone going to his own
house, would turn and ride away from, instead of toward
Salem.</p>
<p>"When she gets to the forks of the road, look
out for squalls," said Master Joseph to himself. For many had been
his own fights with Sweetbriar, when the horse wanted to go towards
his stable, after a long ride, and his young master wanted him to
go in the opposite direction. Sweetbriar had already gone about
twenty miles that day&mdash;and, besides, had been given only the
merest mouthful for dinner, with the object of preparing him for
this special occasion.</p>
<p>The next swell in the ground afforded the
young man an excellent view. Sweetbriar had arrived at the turn
which led to his stable; where rest and oats awaited him; and it
evidently seemed to Him the height of injustice and unreason to be
asked to go all the way back to Salem again. Mistress<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> Ann,
however, knew nothing of these previous experiences of the animal,
but imputed his insubordinate behavior entirely to self-will and
obstinacy. And thus, as the great globe moves around the sun in a
perpetual circle, as the result of the two conflicting forces of
gravitation and fly-off-it-iveness, so Sweetbriar circled around
and around, like a cat chasing his tail, as the result of the
conflicting wills of himself and his rider.</p>
<p>Master Joseph watched the progress of the
whole affair with decided pleasure. "No woman but a witch could get
Sweetbriar past that turn," he said to himself, laughing outright,
"And no man, who had not a pair of spurs on."</p>
<p>At last, getting out of all patience,
Mistress Putnam raised her whip and brought it down sharply on her
horse's shoulder. This decided the struggle; for, unused to such
punishment, the fiery animal reared, and then turning, sprang up
the road that led to his stable at a wild gallop.</p>
<p>His rider as I have said, was not a very good
horse-woman, and she now took hold of the horn of the saddle with
her right hand, to enable her to keep her seat; and tried to
moderate the gait of the horse with the reins and the voice,
abandoning all further resistance to his will as
useless.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg
320]</a></span></p>
<p>Setting off at a run, Master Joseph was able
to reach home just about the same time as his sister-in-law
did.</p>
<p>"Ah! I am glad you changed your mind, Sister
Ann, about going to Salem. It is a great deal more sensible to come
and spend the afternoon with Elizabeth."</p>
<p>"Very glad to see you, Sister Ann," said
Mistress Joseph, coming out to the horse-block, at which
Sweetbriar, from force of habit, had stopped.</p>
<p>Mistress Ann looked offended, and replied
coldly, "I had no intention of coming here this afternoon, Sister
Elizabeth; but this vile brute, which Joseph lent me, after sending
away my own horse, would neither obey the reins nor the
whip."</p>
<p>"You rascal!" said Master Joseph severely,
addressing the horse. "You do not deserve to have a lady ride
you."</p>
<p>"Can you not lend me another horse&mdash;say
the one Elizabeth always rides?"</p>
<p>"All the other horses are out at work,"
replied Master Joseph; "and before I could get one of them in, and
at all groomed up, ready for the saddle, I am afraid it would be
too late for your purpose."</p>
<p>"So I must be compelled to do as you wish,
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg
321]</a></span> stay away from the examination?" said Mistress Ann
bitterly.</p>
<p>"Oh, if you choose, I will put a pillion on
Sweetbriar, and see how that works?" replied Master Joseph with a
meek and patient expression of countenance, as of one upbraided
without cause. "To be sure, Sweetbriar has never been asked to
carry double; but he might as well learn now as ever."</p>
<p>"That seems to be the only thing that can be
done now," and the expression of Mistress Ann's face resembled that
of a martyr who was about to be tied to the stake; for riding on a
pillion brought the lady always into the closest proximity with the
gentleman, and she was now cherishing towards Master Joseph a
temper that could hardly be called sisterly.</p>
<p>There was necessarily a great waste of time
in getting the pillion on Sweetbriar. He never had carried double,
and he evidently felt insulted by being asked to do it. Master
Joseph glanced at the sun, and knew it must be now full two
o'clock. Only by fast riding, would it be possible to get to Salem
court-house by three; and the roads, as they then were, did not
admit of fast riding except in a few places.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg
322]</a></span></p>
<p>It was no easy thing for Mistress Ann to get
on Sweetbriar, for the horse backed and sidled off from the
horse-block whenever she attempted it&mdash;all his sweetness
seemed gone by this time, and the briars alone remained. At least
fifteen minutes more were lost in this way. But at last the
difficult feat was accomplished.</p>
<p>"Hold on to me tightly," said the young man,
"or you will be thrown off&mdash;" for the irritated animal began
to curvet around in all directions, manifesting a strong
determination to go back to his stable, instead of forward towards
Salem.</p>
<p>"I think we had better try the other road,
and not pass the forks where you had so much trouble with him,"
said Master Joseph, as the horse went more quietly, going up the
first hill.</p>
<p>"As you think best," said his sister-in-law,
in a sharp tone, "If I had a horse like this I would shoot
him!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Sweetbriar is good enough usually. I
never saw him so violent and troublesome as he is to-day. And I
think I know the reason of it."</p>
<p>"What is the reason?"</p>
<p>"I fear he has an 'evil hand' upon him," said
Master Joseph with great solemnity.</p>
<p>"Nonsense," replied Mistress Ann
sharply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg
323]</a></span></p>
<p>"He has got the wicked One in him; that is
the matter with him."</p>
<p>"That is about the same thing," said Master
Joseph.</p>
<p>Now they were at the top of the hill, and the
horse broke into tantrums again; requiring all of Master Joseph's
skill to prevent his toppling himself and his two riders over one
of the many boulders that obstructed the road.</p>
<p>"If you do not hold on to me more tightly,
Sister Ann, you will be thrown off," said Master Joseph, putting
back his right hand to steady her. And Mistress Ann was compelled
to lock her arms around him, or take the chance of serious injury
from being dashed to the rough highway. The young man would have
liked to relieve his feelings by a hearty burst of laughter, as he
felt her arms embracing him so warmly, but of course he dared
not.</p>
<p>They soon came near the main road, running
due north and south, and which it was necessary to take, as it led
directly down to Salem. Sweetbriar knew that road well&mdash;and
that he never stopped when once turned to the south on it, short of
a six mile ride. He remembered his recent victorious struggle at
the Forks, and now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id=
"Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> resolved upon another battle. All of
Master Putnam's efforts&mdash;or what seemed so&mdash;could not get
him headed southward on that road. In truth, burdened as he was,
the young man really could not do it, without incurring too much
risk to the lady behind him. Those who have ever had such a battle
with a wilful, mettlesome horse, know that it often requires the
utmost patience and determination on the part of his rider, to come
out victorious. The best plan&mdash;the writer speaks from some
experience&mdash;is to pull the animal round in a circle until his
brain becomes confused, and then start him off in the right
direction.</p>
<p>But Sweetbriar evidently had a better brain
than usual, for when the whirl came to an end, it always found his
pointing like the magnetic needle to the north. It had been Master
Joseph's plan to pretend a good deal of earnestness in the struggle
which he was certain would come in this place; but he was pleased
to find that there was no need of any pretence in the matter. The
horse, under the circumstances, the young man having a lady's
safety to consult, was the master. Repeated trials only proved it.
Whenever the fierce, final tug of war came, Mistress Ann's safety
had to be consulted, and the horse had his own way. So,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> as
the result Sweetbriar started off in a sharp canter up, instead of
down, the road.</p>
<p>"Take me home then," said his
sister-in-law&mdash;"if you will not take me to Salem."</p>
<p>"If I <i>will</i> not," repeated Master
Joseph. "I give you my honest word, Sister Ann, that I could not
make this horse go down the road, with us two on his back, if I
stayed here all the afternoon trying. I should think you must have
seen that."</p>
<p>"No matter. Take me home."</p>
<p>"Besides, we could not get to Salem before
four o'clock now, if Sweetbriar went his best and
prettiest."</p>
<p>"I give it up. Let us turn and go
home."</p>
<p>"If we turn and go back the way we came, I do
not think I shall be able to get this self-willed animal past my
own gate."</p>
<p>"Well, what do you mean to do?" said the lady
bitterly. "Ride on up to Topsfield?"</p>
<p>Master Joseph laughed. "No&mdash;there is a
road strikes off towards your house a short distance above here,
and I think I can get you home by it, without any further
trouble."</p>
<p>"Very well&mdash;get me home as soon as you
can. I do not feel like any further riding, or much more
talking."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg
326]</a></span></p>
<p>"Of course it is very aggravating," replied
Master Putnam soothingly, "but then you know as Master Parris says,
that all these earthly disappointments are our most valuable
experiences&mdash;teaching us not to set our hopes upon worldly
things, but upon those of a more enduring and satisfying
character."</p>
<p>His sister-in-law's face, that he could not
see, she being behind him, wore a look as she listened to this,
which could be hardly called evangelical.</p>
<p>"You wished very much I know to go this
afternoon to Salem," continued Master Joseph, in the same
sermonizing tone; "but doubtless your wish has been overruled for
good. I think, as a member of church, you should be willing to
acquiesce patiently in the singular turn that affairs have taken,
and console yourself with the thought that you have been innocently
riding these peaceful roads instead of being in Salem, doing
perchance an infinite deal of mischief."</p>
<p>"No doubt what you are saying seems to you
very wise and edifying, Joseph Putnam, but I have a bad headache,
and do not care to converse any further."</p>
<p>"But you must admit that your projected visit
has been frustrated in a very singular, if not remark<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>able
manner?" Master Joseph knew that he had her now at an advantage;
she was compelled to listen to everything he chose to say. His
saddle was even better in that respect than the minister's
pulpit&mdash;you might leave a church, but she could not leave the
horse.</p>
<p>"I do not see anything very miraculous,
brother Joseph, in a young man like you having a self-willed and
unprincipled horse. In truth, the wonder would be if you had a
decent and well-governed animal," replied his sister-in-law
wrathfully.</p>
<p>The young man smiled at the retort, but she
could not see the gleam of sunshine as it passed rapidly over his
face; lingering a moment in the soft depths of his sweet blue eyes.
There was no smile however in his voice, but the previous
solemnity, as he continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"And yet if Balaam's ass could see the angel
of the Lord, with his drawn-sword, standing in the way, and barring
his further progress in wrongdoing, why might not this
horse&mdash;who is much more intelligent than an ass&mdash;have
seen a similar vision?"</p>
<p>The young man had begun this speech somewhat
in sport; but as he ended it, the assumed tone of<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
solemnity had passed into one of real earnestness. For, as he asked
himself, "Why should it not be? This woman with him was bound on a
wicked errand. Why should not the angel or the Lord stand in her
way also&mdash;and the horse see him, even if his riders did
not?"</p>
<p>Mistress Putnam made no answer. Perhaps now
that the young man was really in earnest, what he said made some
impression upon her, but, more probably it did not.</p>
<p>He, too, relapsed into silence. It seemed to
him a good place to stop his preaching, and let his sister-in-law
think over what he had said.</p>
<p>"Thank Heaven we are here at last!" said the
baffled woman, as they rode up to the horse-block at her own door.
Sweetbriar stood very quiet, and she stepped on the block, Master
Joseph keeping his seat.</p>
<p>"Will you dismount and stay to supper,
brother Joseph?" said Mistress Ann, in a soft purring tone. Master
Joseph fairly started with his surprise, and looked steadily into
her dark, inscrutable eyes&mdash;eyes like Jael's as she gazed upon
sleeping Sisera.</p>
<p>"No, I thank you&mdash;I expect a friend to
supper. I hope brother Thomas heard some good news at<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Ipswich. Come and see us when you feel like it." And he rode
off.</p>
<p>As he told his wife afterwards, he would not
have taken supper with his sister Ann that evening as he valued his
life.</p>
<p>And yet perhaps it was all
imagination&mdash;and he did not see that thing lurking in the
depths of his sister-in-law's cold, unfathomable eyes that he
thought he did. And yet her testimony against Rebecca Nurse, reads
to us, even at this late day, with all the charity that we are
disposed to exercise towards things so long past, as cold-blooded,
deliberate murder.</p>

<h4>The Two Plotters Congratulate Each
Other.</h4>
<p>When Master Joseph arrived home, he told his
wife of what a perverse course things had taken, amid his own and
her frequent laughter. And then he could do nothing else than walk
up and down impatiently, glancing at frequent intervals towards the
road, to see if anybody were coming.</p>
<p>In the course of an hour or so, nobody
appearing and Sweetbriar being sweetened up again by a good feed,
he ordered the horse brought out. Then he was persuaded by his wife
to recall the order, and wait patiently till sundown.</p>
<p>"What impatient creatures you men are!" said
Mistress Elizabeth with feminine superiority. "Doubtless he will be
along. Give him sufficient time. Now, do not worry, husband mine,
but take things patiently."</p>
<p>So Master Joseph was induced to control his
restlessness and just as soon as he could have been reasonably
expected, Master Raymond was seen riding up the lane at a light
canter.</p>
<p>"Hurrah!" cried Master Joseph, running to
meet him. "And is it all over?"<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>
<p>"We have smitten Ammon, hip and thigh, from
Aroer even till thou come to Minnith!" answered Master Raymond,
laughing. "It was you that kept the she-wolf away, I know. How did
you do it?"</p>
<p>"Come in and I will tell you all about it.
And I want to hear how all went off in Salem."</p>
<p>After a couple of hours' conversation, broken
frequently by irresponsible bursts of laughter, the young men were
mutually enlightened; and complimented each other upon the success
with which they had worked out their respective schemes&mdash;while
young Mistress Elizabeth complimented them both, thinking honestly
in her innocent heart that two such wonderful young men certainly
had never before existed.</p>
<p>"How I should like to have seen you
astonishing old Squire Hathorne," said Master Joseph.</p>
<p>"I am afraid you would have spoiled all by
laughing," said his young wife. "You know you never can control
your merriment, Joseph."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id=
"Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>
<p>"I cannot? You should have seen me preaching
to sister Ann this afternoon. I kept my face all the time as sober
as a judge's. You know she had to take it all quietly&mdash;she
could not even run away from it."</p>
<p>"I would have given one of your five-pound
Massachusetts notes to see it," said Master Raymond. "And five
pounds more to see your brother Thomas stamping up and down the
bar-room of the 'Crown and Anchor,' waiting for that Ipswich man to
meet him."</p>
<p>"I was very careful all through not to tell a
direct falsehood," said Master Joseph; "it is bad enough to deceive
people, without being guilty of downright lying."</p>
<p>"Oh, of course," replied Master Raymond. "I
do not know that I told a downright lie either, all day; although I
must admit that I acted a pretty big one. But you must deal with
fools according to their folly&mdash;you know we have Scripture for
that."</p>
<p>"I do not think I would have done it merely
to save myself," said Master Joseph, evidently a little
conscience-smitten. "But to save you, my friend, that seems to be
different."</p>
<p>"And Dulcibel," added Master Raymond. "If I
were imprisoned what would become of her?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I am glad I did it," responded his
friend, regaining his confidence. "I have really hurt neither
brother Thomas nor Sister Ann; on the contrary, I have prevented
them from doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id=
"Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> a great wrong. I am willing to
answer for this day's work at the Last Day&mdash;and I feel certain
that then at least, both of them will thank me for it."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt of it," said Mistress
Elizabeth who herself brought up in the rigid Puritan school, had
felt the same misgivings as her husband, but whose scruples were
also removed by this last consideration.</p>
<p>As for Master Raymond, he, being more a man
of the world, had felt no scruples at playing such a deceitful
part. I am afraid, that to save Dulcibel, he would not have
scrupled at open and downright lying. Not that he had not all the
sensitiveness of an honorable man as to his word; but because he
looked upon the whole affair as a piece of malicious wickedness, in
defiance of all just law, and which every true-hearted man was
bound to oppose and defeat by all means allowable in open or secret
warfare.</p>
<p>"I suppose you go back to Boston to morrow?"
said his host, as they were about to separate for the
night.</p>
<p>"Yes, immediately after breakfast. This
affair is a warning to me, to push my plans to a consummation as
soon as possible. I think I know what their next move will
be&mdash;a shrewd man once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334"
id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> said, just think what is the
wisest thing for your enemies to do, and provide against
that."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Remove the Governor."</p>
<p>"Why, I understood he was a mere puppet in
the hands of the two Mathers."</p>
<p>"He would be perhaps; but there is a Lady
Phips."</p>
<p>"Ah!' the gray mare is the better horse,' is
she, as it is over at brother Thomas's?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I think so. Now mark my prediction,
friend Joseph; the first blow will be struck at Lady Mary. If Sir
William resists, as I feel certain that he will&mdash;for he is, if
not well educated, a thoroughly manly man&mdash;then he will be
ousted from his position. You will note that it has been the game
all through to strike at any one, man or woman, who came between
these vampires and their prey. I know of only one
exception."</p>
<p>"Ah, who is that?"</p>
<p>"Yourself."</p>
<p>Master Joseph smiled grimly. "They value
their own lives very highly, friend Raymond; and know that to
arrest me would be no child's play. Besides, Sweetbriar is never
long unsaddled; and he is the fastest horse in Salem."<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg
335]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, and to add to all that, you are a
Putnam; and your wife is closely connected with Squire
Hathorne."</p>
<p>"There may be something in that," said his
friend.</p>
<p>"Yes, even Mistress Ann has her limits, which
her husband&mdash;submissive in so many things&mdash;will not allow
her to pass. But we are both a little tired, after such an eventful
day. Good night!"</p>

<h4>Mistress Ann's Opinion of the
Matter.</h4>
<p>While the foregoing conversation was taking
place, one of a very different kind was passing between Mistress
Ann and her worthy husband. He had gathered up all the particulars
he could of the examination and had brought them home to his wife
for her instruction.</p>
<p>After listening to all that he had to tell,
with at least outward calmness, she said bitterly: "The whole thing
was a trick, you see, to keep you and me away from
Salem."</p>
<p>"Do you think so? Do you think then, that no
man really wanted to see me at Ipswich?"</p>
<p>"It is as plain as the nose on your face,"
replied his wife. "You were to be decoyed off to Ipswich, my horse
sent out of the way, and then Joseph's madcap horse offered to me,
they knowing well that the worthless creature would not behave
himself with any woman on his back."</p>
<p>"Oh, pshaw, Ann; you do not mean that my
simple-hearted brother, Joseph Putnam, ever planned and carried out
a subtle scheme of that kind?" said honest Thomas, with an older
brother's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg
337]</a></span> undervaluation of the capabilities of a mere boy
like Joseph.</p>
<p>"I do not say that Joseph thought it all out,
for very probably he did not; doubtless that Master Raymond put him
up to it&mdash;for he seems cunning and unprincipled enough for
anything, judging, by what you have told me of his ridiculous
doings."</p>
<p>"You may call them ridiculous, Ann; but they
impressed everybody very much indeed. Dr. Griggs, told me that he
had no doubt whatever that an 'evil hand' was on him."</p>
<p>"Dr. Griggs is an old simpleton," said his
wife crossly.</p>
<p>"And even Squire Hathorne says that he never
saw a stronger case of spectral persecution. Why, when one of the
young men thrust the point of his rapier at the yellow bird, some
of its feathers were cut off and came fluttering to the ground.
Squire Hathorne says he never saw anything more
wonderful."</p>
<p>"Nonsense&mdash;it is all
trickery!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id=
"Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>"Trickery? Why, my dear wife, the
Squire has the feathers!&mdash;and he means to send them at once to
Master Cotton Mather by a special messenger, to confute all the
scoffers and unbelievers in Boston and Plymouth!"</p>
<p>A scornful reply was at the end of his wife's
tongue but, on second thought, she did not allow it to get any
farther. Suppose that she did convince her husband and Squire
Hathorne that they had been grossly deceived and imposed
upon&mdash;and that Master Raymond's apparent afflictions and
spectral appearance were the result of skilful juggling, what then?
Would their enlightenment stop there? How about the pins that the
girls had concealed around their necks, and taken up with their
mouths? How about Mary Walcot secretly biting herself, and then
screaming out that good Rebecca Nurse had bitten her? How about the
little prints on the arms of the "afflicted girls," which they
allowed were made by the teeth of little Dorcas Good, that child
not five years old; and which Mistress Ann knew were made by the
girls themselves? How about the bites and streaks and bruises which
she herself had shown as the visible proof that the spectre of good
Rebecca Nurse, then lying in jail, was biting her and beating her
with her chains? For Edward Putnam had sworn: "I saw the marks both
of bite and chains."</p>
<p>Perhaps it was safer to let Master Raymond's
juggling go unexposed, considering that she herself<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> and
the "afflicted girls" had done so very much of it.</p>
<p>Therefore she said, "I have no faith in
Master Raymond nevertheless; no more than Moses had in King
Pharaoh's sorcerers, when they did the very same miracles before
the king that he had done. I believe him now to be a cunning and a
very bad young man, and I think if I had been on the spot, instead
of his being at this very moment as I have very little doubt, over
at brother's, where they are congratulating each other on the
success of their unprincipled plans, Master Raymond would now be
lying in Salem jail."</p>
<p>"Probably you are correct, my dear,"
responded her husband meekly; "and I think it not unlikely that
Master Raymond may have thought the same, and planned to keep you
away&mdash;but it was evident to me, that if the 'afflicted girls'
had taken one side or the other in the matter, it would not have
been yours. Why, even our own daughter Ann, was laughing and joking
with him when I entered the court room."</p>
<p>"Yes," said his wife disdainfully&mdash;"that
is girl-nature, all over the earth! Just put a handsome young man
before them, who has seen the world, and is full of his smiles and
flatteries and cajole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id=
"Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>ments, and the wisest of women can do
nothing with them. But the cold years bring them out of that!" she
added bitterly. "They find what they call love, is a folly and a
snare."</p>
<p>Her husband looked out of the window into the
dark night, and made no reply to this outburst. He had always loved
his wife, and he thought, when he married her, that she loved
him&mdash;although he was an excellent match, so far as property
and family were concerned. Still she would occasionally talk in
this way; and he hoped and trusted that it did not mean
much.</p>
<p>"I think myself," he said at length, "that it
is quite as much the pretty gifts he has made them, and has
promised to send them from England, as his handsome face and
pleasant manners."</p>
<p>"Oh, of course, it all goes together. They
are a set of mere giggling girls; and that is all you can make of
them. And our daughter Ann is as bad as any of the lot. I wish she
did not take so much after your family, Thomas."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id=
"Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>This roused her husband a little. "I
am sure, Ann, that our family are much stronger and healthier than
your own are. And as to Ann's being like the other girls, I wish
she was. She is about the only delicate and nervous one among
them."</p>
<p>"Well, Thomas, if you have got at last upon
that matter of the superiority of the Putnams to everybody else in
the Province, I think I shall go to bed," retorted his wife. "That
is the only thing that you are thoroughly unreasonable about. But I
do not think you ever had a single minister, or any learned
scholar, in your family, or ever owned a whole island, in the
Merrimack river as my family, the Harmons, always have done, since
the country was first settled&mdash;and probably always shall, for
the next five hundred years."</p>
<p>To this Thomas Putnam had no answer. He knew
well that he had no minister and no island in his family&mdash;and
those two things, in his wife's estimation, were things that no
family of any reputation should be without. He had not brought on
the discussion, although his wife had accused him of so doing, and
had only asserted what he thought the truth in stating that the
Putnams were the stronger and sturdier race.</p>
<p>"I do not wish to hurt your feelings, Thomas,
in reminding you of these things," continued his wife, finding he
was not intending to reply; "I will admit that your family is a
very reputable and worthy one, even if it is not especially gifted
with intellect like the Harmons, else you may be sure<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> that
I should not have married into it. But I have a headache, and do
not wish to continue this discussion any longer, as it is
unpleasant to me, and besides in very bad taste."</p>
<p>And so, taking the hint, Master Putnam, like
a dutiful husband, who really loved his somewhat peevish and
fretful wife, acknowledged by his silence in the future that the
Harmons were much superior to any family that could not boast of
possessing a minister and an island; the latter for five hundred
years!</p>

<h4>Master Raymond Visits Lady Mary.</h4>
<p>When Master Raymond returned to Boston, he
found that an important event had taken place in his absence.
Captain Alden and Master Philip English and his wife, had all
escaped from prison, and were nowhere to be found. How Captain
Alden had managed things with the jailer the young man was not able
to ascertain&mdash;probably however, by a liberal use of money. As
for Master English and his wife, they were, as I have already said,
at liberty in the day time, under heavy bonds; and had nothing to
do but walk off sometime between sunrise and sundown. As Master
English's ship, "The Porcupine," had been lying for a week or two
in Boston harbor, and left with a brisk northwest wind early in the
morning of the day when they were reported missing, it was not
difficult for anyone to surmise as to their mode of escape. As to
Captain Alden, he might or might not have gone with
them.</p>
<p>As was natural, there was a good deal of
righteous indignation expressed by all in authority. The jailer was
reprimanded for his carelessness in<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> the case of Captain
Alden, and warned that if another prisoner escaped, he would
forfeit his, of late, very profitable position. And the large
properties of both gentlemen were attached and held as being
subject to confiscation.</p>
<p>But while the magistrates and officials
usually were in earnest in these proceedings, it was generally
believed that the Governor, influenced by Lady Mary, had secretly
favored the escaping parties. The two ministers of South
Church&mdash;Masters Willard and Moody&mdash;were also known to
have frequently visited the Captain and Master English in their
confinement, and to have expressed themselves very freely in
public, relative to the absurdity of the charges which had been
made against them. Master Moody had even gone so far as to preach a
sermon on the text, 'When they persecute you in this city, flee ye
into another,' which was supposed by many to have a direct bearing
on the case of the accused. And it is certain that soon afterwards,
the Reverend Master Moody found it expedient to resign his position
in South Church and go back to his old home in
Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Anxious to learn the true inwardness of all
this matter, Master Raymond called a few days after<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> his
return to see Lady Mary. Upon sending in his name, a maid
immediately appeared, and he was taken as before to the boudoir
where he found her ladyship eagerly awaiting him.</p>
<p>"And so you are safely out of the lion's den,
Master Raymond," said she, laughing. "I heard you had passed
through securely."</p>
<p>The young man smiled. "Yes, thanks to
Providence, and to a good friend of mine in Salem."</p>
<p>"Tell me all about it," said the lady. "I
have had the magisterial account already, and now wish to have
yours."</p>
<p>"Will your ladyship pardon me if I ask a
question first? I am so anxious to hear about Mistress Dulcibel.
Have you seen her lately&mdash;and is she well?"</p>
<p>"As well and as blooming as ever. The keeper
and his wife treat her very kindly&mdash;and I think would continue
to do so&mdash;even if the supply of British gold pieces were to
fail. By the way, she might be on the high seas now&mdash;or rather
in New York&mdash;if she had so chosen."</p>
<p>"I wish she had. Why did she not go with
them?"</p>
<p>"Because your arrest complicated things
so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg
346]</a></span> She would not go and leave you in the hands of the
Philistines."</p>
<p>"Oh, that was foolish."</p>
<p>"I think so, too; but I do not think that you
are exactly the person to say so," responded the lady, a little
offended at what seemed a want of appreciation of the sacrifice
that Dulcibel had made on his account.</p>
<p>But Master Raymond appeared not to notice the
rebuke. He simply added: "If I could have been there to counsel
her, I would have convinced her that I was in no serious
danger&mdash;for, even if imprisoned, I do not think there is a
jail in the Province that could hold me."</p>
<p>"Well, there was a difficulty with the Keeper
also&mdash;for she had given her word, you know, not to escape,
when she was taken into his house."</p>
<p>"But Captain Alden had also given his word.
How did he manage it?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," replied the lady. "But, to a
hint dropped by Dulcibel, the jailer shook his head resolutely, and
said that no money would tempt him."</p>
<p>"The difficulty in her case then remains the
same as ever," said the young man thoughtfully, and a little
gloomily. "She might go into the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> prison. But that would
be to give warning that she had planned to escape. Besides, it is
such a vile place, that I hate the idea of her passing a single
night in one of its sickening cells."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I can wring a pardon out of Sir
William," said the lady musing.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lady Mary, if you only could, we should
both forever worship you!"</p>
<p>The lady smiled at the young man's
impassioned language and manner&mdash;he looked as if he would
throw himself at her feet.</p>
<p>"I should be too glad to do it. But Sir
William just now is more rigid than ever. He had a call yesterday
from his pastor, Master Cotton Mather, and a long talk from him
about the witches. Master Mather, it seems, has had further
evidence and of the most convincing character, of the reality of
these spectral appearances."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" said Master Raymond showing great
interest for he had an idea of what was coming.</p>
<p>"Yes, in a recent examination at Salem before
Squire Hathorne, a young man struck with his sword at a spectral
yellow bird which was tormenting an afflicted person; and several
small yellow feathers were cut off by the thrust, and floated down
to the floor. Squire Hathorne writes to<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
Master Mather that he would not have believed it, if he had not
seen it; but, as it was, he would be willing to take his oath
before any Court in Christendom, that this wonderful thing really
occurred."</p>
<p>Master Raymond could not help
laughing.</p>
<p>"I see you have no more faith in the story
than I have," continued Lady Mary. "But it had a great effect upon
Sir William, coming from a man of such wonderful learning and
wisdom as Master Cotton Mather. Especially as he said that he had
seen the yellow feathers himself; which had since been sent to him
by Squire Hathorne, and which had a singular smell of sulphur about
them."</p>
<p>The young man broke into a heartier laugh
than before. Then he said scornfully, "It seems to me that no
amount of learning, however great, can make a sensible man out of a
fool."</p>
<p>"Why, you know something about this then? Did
it happen while you were in Salem?"</p>
<p>"I know everything about it," said Master
Raymond, "I am the very man that worked the miracle." And he
proceeded to give Lady Mary a detailed account of the whole affair,
substantially as it is known to the reader.</p>
<p>"By the way, as to the feathers smelling
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg
349]</a></span> sulphur," concluded the young man, "I think that it
is very probable, inasmuch as I observed the jailer's wife that
very morning giving the younger chickens powdered brimstone to cure
them of the pip."</p>
<p>"I think you are a marvelously clever young
man," was the lady's first remark as he concluded his
account.</p>
<p>"Thank your ladyship!" replied Master Raymond
smiling. "I hope I shall always act so as to deserve such a good
opinion."</p>
<p>"I would have given my gold cup&mdash;which
the Duke of Albemarle gave me&mdash;to have been there; especially
when the yellow bird's feathers came floating down to Squire
Hathorne's reverential amazement," said Lady Mary, laughing
heartily. "You must come up here tomorrow morning at noon. Master
Mather is to bring his feathers to show the Governor, and to
astound the Governor's skeptical wife. You are not afraid to come,
are you?"</p>
<p>"I shall enjoy it very much&mdash;that is, if
the Governor will promise that I shall not suffer for my
disclosures. I am free now, and I do not wish to be arrested
again."</p>
<p>"Oh, I will see to that. The Governor will
be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg
350]</a></span> so curious to hear your story, that he will promise
all that you desire as to your safety. Besides, he will not be
sorry to take down Master Mather a little; these Puritan ministers
presume on their vocation too much. They all think they are
perfectly capable of governing not only Provinces, but Kingdoms;
while the whole history of the world proves their utter incapacity
to govern even a village wisely."</p>
<p>"That is true as the gospel, Lady Mary. But
one thing I have always noticed. That while every minister thinks
this, he would himself far rather be governed even by one of the
world's people, than by a minister of any other belief than his
own. So you see they really do think the same as we do about it;
only they do not always know it."</p>
<p>"You are a bright young man," Lady Mary
replied pleasantly, "and I think almost good enough to wear such a
sweet rose next your heart as Mistress Dulcibel."</p>

<h4>Captain Tolley's Propositions.</h4>
<p>That evening as Master Raymond was standing
in the bar-room of the Red Lion, Captain Tolley came in, and after
tossing off a stout glass of rum and water, went out again, giving
the young Englishman a nod and the agreed-upon-signal, a smoothing
of his black beard with the left hand. After the lapse of a few
minutes, Master Raymond followed, going towards the wharves, which
in the evening were almost deserted. Arrived at the end of one of
the wharves, he found the Captain of the Storm King.</p>
<p>"So you got out of the clutches of those
Salem rascals safely?" said the Captain. "I was afraid I should
have to go all the way to Salem for you."</p>
<p>"You would not have deserted me then,
Captain?"</p>
<p>"That is not the kind of a marlinespike I
am," replied the Captain quaintly. "I'd have got you out of Salem
jail, unless it is a good deal stronger than the Boston
one."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Captain, but I am glad there was
no need of your trying."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352"
id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>
<p>"You heard of course that Captain Alden was
off, and Master and Mistress English?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;and very glad I was
too."</p>
<p>"Why did not your sweetheart go with the
Englishes?"</p>
<p>"There were several reasons&mdash;one, a
rather foolish one, she would not leave me in prison."</p>
<p>"She would not?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"D&mdash;&mdash; me! Why that girl is fit to
be a sailor's wife! When we get her off safely I intend to have her
as the figure-head of the Storm King."</p>
<p>"I am afraid that would be a very unhealthy
position&mdash;she might catch a bad cold," replied Master
Raymond.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course I mean in wood, painted white
with red cheeks," said Captain Tolley. "It brings good luck to have
a fine woman for a figure-head&mdash;pleases old Nep, you
know."</p>
<p>"But we must get her off first," rejoined
Master Raymond. "Now to keep out of that hateful jail, she has
given her word to Keeper Arnold not to escape. You know she cannot
break her word."</p>
<p>"Of course not," replied the Captain; "a lady
is like a sailor, she cannot go back on her promise."<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg
353]</a></span></p>
<p>"And there is where the trouble comes
in."</p>
<p>"Buy Keeper Arnold over."</p>
<p>"I am afraid I cannot&mdash;not for a good
while at least. They are all down upon him for Captain Alden's
escape. They might give him a terrible whipping if another prisoner
got off."</p>
<p>The Captain shrugged his shoulders. "Yes, I
saw them whip some Quakers once. It was not a good honest lash, but
something the hangman had got up on purpose, and which cut to the
very bone. I have seen men and women killed, down on the Spanish
main, but I never saw a sight like that! Good, harmless men and
women too! A little touched here, you know," and the Captain tapped
his forehead lightly with his fore-finger.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;I should not like to hear that
Master Arnold had been tortured like that on our
account."</p>
<p>"Suppose we carry her off some night by
force, she having no hand in the arrangements? She can even refuse
to go, you know, if she pleases&mdash;we will handle her as gently
as a little bird, and you can come up and rescue her, if you
choose, and knock down two or three of us. How would that do?
Half-a-dozen of the Storm King's men could easily do that. Choose a
night with a brisk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id=
"Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> nor'wester, and we would be past the
castle's guns before the sleepy land-lubbers had their eyes
open."</p>
<p>Master Raymond shook his head dubiously. "I
do not like it&mdash;and yet I suppose it must do, if nothing
better can be found. Of course if we carry her off bodily, against
her will, it would neither be a breaking of her pledge nor expose
Keeper Arnold to any danger of after punishment, though he might
perhaps get pretty seriously hurt in resisting us, and she would
not like that much."</p>
<p>"I suppose then we must wait a while longer,"
said the Captain. "I am ready any time you say the word&mdash;only
be careful that a good west or a nor'west wind is blowing. When
once out on the high seas, we can take care of
ourselves."</p>
<p>"Many French privateers out
there?"</p>
<p>"Thick as blackberries. But they are of no
account. Those we cannot fight, we can easily run away from. There
is no craft on these seas, that can overhaul the Storm
King!"</p>
<p>With a hearty shake of the hand the two
parted, the Captain for the vessel of which he was so proud; Master
Raymond for his room in the Red Lion.</p>

<h4>Master Raymond Confounds Master Cotton
Mather.</h4>
<p>The next day, a little before noon, Master
Raymond knocked at the door of the Governor's Mansion, and was at
once conducted to Lady Mary's boudoir. "The Reverend Master Mather
is already with the Governor," said her ladyship, "and I expect to
receive a summons to join them every moment." And in fact the words
were hardly out of her mouth, when Sir William's private secretary,
Master Josslyn, appeared, with a request for her ladyship's
presence.</p>
<p>"Come with me," said she to Master Raymond;
"but do not say anything&mdash;much less smile or laugh&mdash;until
I call upon you for your testimony."</p>
<p>As they entered, the courteous Governor
handed his lady to a seat on the sofa; and Master Mather made a
dignified obeisance.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id=
"Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have brought along a young friend of mine,
who was with me, and would also like to hear of all these wonderful
things," said her ladyship; and Master Raymond bowed very
deferentially to both the high dignities, they returning the bow,
while Sir William politely requested him to be seated.</p>
<p>"I was just on the point of showing to Sir
William the most remarkable curiosities of even this very
remarkable era&mdash;and he suggested that you also doubtless would
like to see them," said the minister; at this time a man of about
thirty years of age. He was a rather comely and intelligent looking
man, and Master Raymond wondered that one who appeared so
intellectual, should be the victim of such absurd
hallucinations.</p>
<p>Lady Mary bent her head approvingly, in
answer to the minister. "I should like very much to see them," she
replied courteously; and Master Mather continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In the work I have been preparing on the
"Wonders of the Invisible World," several of the sheets of which I
have already shown to Sir William, I have collected many curious
and wonderful instances. Thus in the case of the eldest daughter of
Master John Goodwin, whom I took to my own house, in order that I
might more thoroughly investigate the spiritual and physical
phenomena of witchcraft, I found that while the devils that
tormented her were familiar with Latin, Greek and Hebrew, they
seemed to have very little knowledge of the various Indian
dialects."</p>
<p>"That certainly is very curious," replied
Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg
357]</a></span> William, "inasmuch as those heathen are undeniably
the children of the devil, as all our wisest and most godly
ministers agree."</p>
<p>"Yes," continued the minister, "it is true;
and that makes me conjecture, that these devils were in fact only
playing a part; to deceive me into thinking that the red heathen
around us were not really the children of Satan, as they
undoubtedly are."</p>
<p>"I think that the most reasonable view,"
responded the Governor.</p>
<p>"As to the reality of this new assault by
Satan upon this little seed of God's people in the new world,"
continued Master Mather, fervently, "I have now no doubt whatever.
Proof has been multiplied upon proof, and the man, or woman, who
does not by this time believe, is simply one of those deplorable
doubters, like Thomas, who never can be convinced. For my part, I
consider Witchcraft the most nefandous high treason against the
Majesty on High! And a principal design of my book is to manifest
its hideous enormity, and to promote a pious thankfulness to God
that Justice so far is being inflexibly executed among
us."</p>
<p>Lady Mary's face flushed a little, for she
saw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg
358]</a></span> drift of the minister's censure. It was well known
in all the inner circles, that she had neither faith in the reality
of witchcraft, nor the least sympathy with the numerous
prosecutions, and the inflexible justice which the minister lauded.
The Governor knew his wife's temper, and hastened to
say:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Still we must admit, Master Mather, that
some persons, with tender conscience, require more convincing
proofs than do others. And therefore I was anxious that Lady Mary
should see these feathers you spoke of, cut from the wings of one
of those yellow birds which appear to be used so frequently as
familiars by the Salem witches."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I had forgotten them for the
moment." And putting his hand into his breast pocket, Master Mather
produced a small box, which he opened carefully and called their
attention to a couple of small yellow feathers placed on a piece of
black cloth within. "I would not take a hundred pounds for these
spectral feathers," said the minister exultingly. "They are the
only positive proof of the kind, now existing in the whole world.
With these little feathers I shall dash out the brains of a host of
unbelievers&mdash;especially of that silly Calef, or Caitiff, who
is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg
359]</a></span> all the time going around among the merchants,
wagging his vile tongue against me."</p>
<p>Sir William and Lady Mary had been looking
upon the feathers very curiously. At last Lady Mary gave a low,
incredulous laugh. Her husband looked at her
inquiringly.</p>
<p>"They are nothing but common chicken feathers
which could be picked up in any barn yard," she said
scornfully.</p>
<p>"Your ladyship is very much mistaken, you
never saw chicken feathers like those," said the minister, his face
now also flushing.</p>
<p>"Who was the yellow bird afflicting, when
these feathers were cut?" the lady asked.</p>
<p>"A young man was on his examination for
witchcraft, Squire Hathorne writes me; but he was found to be
himself a victim, and was released&mdash;which proves, by the way,
how careful the worshipful magistrates are in Salem, lest any who
are innocent should be implicated with the guilty. The young man
began to cry out that an 'evil hand' was on him, and that a yellow
bird was trying to peck out his eyes. Whereupon one of the
by-standers pulled out his rapier, and smote at the spectral
bird&mdash;when these feathers were cut off; becoming visible of
course as soon as they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360"
id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> detached from the bird and its
evil influence. It is one of the most wonderful things that I ever
heard of," and Master Mather gazed on the feathers with admiring
and almost reverential eyes.</p>
<p>"Sir William," said his lady, "you have, I
hope, a little common sense left, if these Massachusetts ministers
and magistrates have all gone crazy on this subject. You know what
a chicken is, if they do not. Are not those simply chicken
feathers?"</p>
<p>"Why, my dear," replied the Governor,
wriggling in his great arm-chair, "I grant that they certainly do
look like chicken feathers; but then you know, the yellow bird the
witches use, may have feathers like unto a chicken's."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" replied Lady Mary. "None are so
blind as those that will not see. I suppose that if I were to bring
that afflicted young man here, and he were to acknowledge that the
whole thing was a trick, got up by him to save his life, you would
not believe him?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I should," replied Sir
William.</p>
<p>"Yes, Lady Mary, find the young man, and
question him yourself," said Master Mather. "None are so certain as
those that have never informed themselves. I have made inquiry
into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg
361]</a></span> these marvelous things; I even took that afflicted
girl, as I have told you, into my own house, in order to inform
myself of the truth. When you have investigated the matter to
one-tenth the extent that I have, you will be prepared to give a
reasonable opinion as to its truth or falsehood. Until then, some
modesty of statement would become a lady who sets up her crude
opinion against all the ministers and the magistracy of the
land."</p>
<p>This was a tone which the leading ministers
of that day among the Puritans, did not hesitate to take, even
where high dignitaries were concerned and Master Mather had the
highest ideas of the privilege of his order.</p>
<p>"Then I suppose, Master Mather, that if the
afflicted young man himself should testify that these feathers were
simply chicken feathers, that he had artfully thrown up into the
air, you would not acknowledge that he had deceived
you?"</p>
<p>"If such an impossible thing could happen,
though I know that it could not, of course I should be compelled to
admit that Squire Hathorne and a hundred others, who all saw this
marvelous thing plainly, in open day, were deceived by the trick of
an unprincipled mountebank and juggler."</p>
<p>"I shall hold both you and Sir William to
your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg
362]</a></span> word," replied Lady Mary emphatically. Then,
turning to the young Englishman, who had remained entirely silent
so far, paying evident attention to all that was spoken, but giving
no sign of approval or disapproval, she said, "Master Raymond, what
do you think of this matter?"</p>
<p>Master Raymond rose from his chair and
stepped a pace or two forward. Then he said, "If I answer your
ladyship's question freely, it might be to my own hurt. Having had
my head once in the lion's mouth, I am not anxious to put it there
again."</p>
<p>The lady looked significantly at Sir
William.</p>
<p>"Speak out truly, and fear nothing, young
man," said the Governor. "Nothing that you say here shall ever work
you injury while I am Governor of the Province."</p>
<p>"What do you wish to know, Lady
Mary?"</p>
<p>"You, I believe, were the afflicted young
man, to whom Master Mather has referred?"</p>
<p>Master Raymond bowed.</p>
<p>"Was there any reality in those pretended
afflictions?"</p>
<p>"Only a bad cold to begin with," said the
young man smiling.</p>
<p>"How about the yellow bird?"<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg
363]</a></span></p>
<p>"It was all a sham. I dealt with credulous
and dangerous fools according to their folly."</p>
<p>"How about those feathers?"</p>
<p>"They are feathers I got from the wings of
one of the Salem jailor's chickens."</p>
<p>Sir William laughed,</p>
<p>"How about the smell of sulphur which Squire
Hathorne and Master Mather have detected in the
feathers?"</p>
<p>"I think it very probable; as I observed
Goodwife Foster that morning giving her chickens powdered brimstone
for the pip."</p>
<p>Here the Governor laughed loudly and long
until Master Mather said indignantly, "I am sorry, Sir William,
that you can treat so lightly this infamous confession of falsehood
and villainy. This impudent young man deserves to be set for three
days in the pillory, and then whipped at the cart's tail out of
town."</p>
<p>"Of course it is a very shameful piece of
business," replied the Governor, regaining his gravity. "But you
know that as the confession has been made only on the promise of
perfect immunity, I cannot, as a man of my word, suffer the least
harm to come to the young person for making it."</p>
<p>"Oh, of course not," said the minister,
taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg
364]</a></span> up his hat, and preparing to leave the room; "but
it is scandalous! scandalous! All respect for the Magistracy and
authority seems to be fading out of the popular mind. I consider
you a dangerous man, a very dangerous young man!" This last of
course to Master Raymond.</p>
<p>"And I consider you tenfold more dangerous
with your clerical influence, and credulity, and superstition!"
replied the young Englishman hotly. Being of good family, he was
not inclined to take such insults mildly. "How dare you, with your
hands all red with the blood of twenty innocent men and women, talk
to me about being dangerous!"</p>
<p>"Peace!" said Sir William with dignity. "My
audience chamber is no place to quarrel in.</p>
<p>"I beg your Excellency's pardon!" said Master
Raymond, humbly.</p>
<p>"One moment, before you go," said Lady Mary,
stepping in front of the minister. "I suppose you will be as good
as your word, Master Mather and admit that with all your wisdom you
were entirely mistaken?"</p>
<p>"I acknowledge that Squire Hathorne and
myself have been grossly deceived by an unprincipled
adventurer&mdash;but that proves nothing. Because<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Jannes and Jambres imitated with their sorceries the miracles of
Moses, did it prove that Moses was an impostor? There was one Judas
among the twelve apostles, but does that invalidate the credibility
of the eleven others, who were not liars and cheats? It is the
great and overwhelming burden of the testimony which decides in
this as in all other disputed matters&mdash;not mere isolated
cases. Good afternoon, madam. I will see you soon again, Sir
William, when we can have a quiet talk to ourselves."</p>
<p>"Stay!" cried Lady Mary, as the offended
minister was stalking out of the room. "You have forgotten
something," and she pointed to the little box, containing the
chicken's feathers which had been left lying upon the
table.</p>
<p>The minister gave a gesture expressive of
mingled contempt and indignation&mdash;but did not come back for
it. It was evident that he valued the feathers now at considerably
less than one hundred pounds.</p>
<p>"Young man," said the Governor, smiling, "you
are a very bright and keen-witted person, but I would advise you
not to linger in this province any longer than is absolutely
necessary. Master Mather is much stronger here than I
am."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id=

<h4>Bringing Affairs to a Crisis.</h4>
<p>The next morning a note came to Master
Raymond from Joseph Putnam, brought by one of the
farm-hands.</p>
<p>It was important. Abigail Williams had called
upon Goodwife Buckley, and told her in confidence that it was in
contemplation, as she had learned from Ann Putnam, to bring
Dulcibel Burton back to Salem jail again. The escape of Captain
Alden and the Englishes from the Bridewell in Boston, had caused a
doubt in Salem as to its security. Besides, Lady Phips had taken
ground so openly against the witch prosecutions, that there was no
knowing to how great an extent she might not go to aid any prisoner
in whom she took an interest.</p>
<p>Abigail Williams further said that Mistress
Ann Putnam had become very bitter both against her brother-in-law
Joseph and his friend Master Raymond. She was busy combatting the
idea that the latter really ever had been afflicted&mdash;and was
endeavoring to rouse Squire Hathorne's indignation against him as
being a deceiver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id=
"Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>
<p>As the young man read this last, he wondered
what effect would be produced upon the credulous magistrate, when
he received word from Master Mather as to what had occurred in the
Governor's presence. Would he be so angry as to take very arbitrary
measures; or so ashamed as to let it all pass, rather than expose
the extent to which he had been duped? He feared the
former&mdash;knowing in which way Mistress Ann Putnam's great
influence with him would be directed.</p>
<p>Master Joseph advised immediate
action&mdash;if peaceable means would not serve, then the use of
violent ones. If Captain Tolley could not find among his sailors
those who would undertake the job, he, Master Joseph, would come
down any night with three stout men, overpower the keepers, and
carry off Mistress Dulcibel, with the requisite amount of violence
to keep her promise unbroken.</p>
<p>Master Raymond wrote a note in return. He was
much obliged for the information. It was evident that the time had
come for action; and that it was dangerous to delay much longer. Of
course peaceable means were to be preferred; and it was possible he
might be able either to bribe the keeper, or to get a release from
the Governor; but, if force had to be resorted to,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
Captain Tolley could command his whole crew for such a service, as
they were the kind of men who would like nothing better. In fact,
they would not hesitate to open fire upon the town, if he ordered
it&mdash;and even run up the flag of a French privateer.</p>
<p>After dispatching this business, Master
Raymond went out on the porch of the Red Lion, and began an
examination of the clouds and the weather-cocks. It had been
raining slightly for a day or two, with the wind from the
southeast; but though the vanes still pointed to the southeast, and
the light lower clouds were moving from the same point of the
compass, he caught glimpses through the scud of higher clouds that
were moving in an entirely opposite direction.</p>
<p>"How do you make it out?" said a well-known
voice. He had heard some one approaching, but had supposed it to be
a stranger.</p>
<p>"I am not much of a sailor; but I should say
it would clear up, with a brisk wind from the west or the northwest
by afternoon."</p>
<p>"Aye!" said Captain Tolley, for it was he;
"and a stiff nor'wester by night. If it isn't I'll give my head for
a foot-ball. Were I bound out of the harbor, I would not whistle
for a better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id=
"Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span> wind than we shall have before six
hours are over."</p>
<p>Master Raymond glanced around; no one was
near them. "Are you certain of that, Captain? Would it do to bet
upon?</p>
<p>"You may bet all you are worth, and your
sweetheart into the bargain," replied the Captain laughing, with a
significant look out of his eyes.</p>
<p>"When are you going, Captain?"</p>
<p>"Oh, to-night, perhaps&mdash;if I can get all
my live stock on board.</p>
<p>"To-night then let it be," said the young man
in a whisper; "by fair means, or by foul. I may succeed by fair
means; have a boat waiting at the wharf for me. It will be light
enough to get out of the harbor?"</p>
<p>"There is a gibbous moon&mdash;plenty. Once
past the castle, and we are safe. We can easily break open the
keeper's house&mdash;and quiet him with a pistol at his
head."</p>
<p>"You must not harm him&mdash;he has been a
good friend to her."</p>
<p>"Of course&mdash;only scare him a little.
Besides, he is not a good friend, if he makes a noise."</p>
<p>"Well, I will see you by ten
o'clock&mdash;with her or without her&mdash;Yes, I will bet you a
gold piece,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id=
"Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span> Captain, that the wind gets around
to the west by four o'clock." This last was in Master Raymond's
usual tones&mdash;the previous conversation having been in
whispers.</p>
<p>"You will be safe enough in that, Master
Raymond," said the landlord of the Red Lion, whose steps the young
Englishman had heard approaching.</p>
<p>"Do you think so? I do not want to take the
young man's money, he is only a landsman you know, Mate; but I will
bet you a piece of eight that the wind will not get around till a
half hour after that time. And we will take it all out in drinks at
your bar, at our leisure."</p>
<p>"Done!" said the landlord. "And now let us go
in, and take a drink all around in advance."</p>

<h4>Lady Mary's Coup D'Etat.</h4>
<p>Master Raymond's next proceeding was to call
on Lady Phips. Sending in his name, with a request to see her
ladyship on very important business, he was ushered as usual into
her boudoir.</p>
<p>"I must be doing something, Lady Mary," he
said, after a few words relative to the evident change of weather;
"I have news from Salem that the Magistrates are about to send
Mistress Dulcibel back to Salem jail."</p>
<p>"That is sad," she answered.</p>
<p>"And, besides, there is no knowing what new
proceedings they may be concocting against me. I must take Sir
William's advice, and get out of this hornet's nest as soon as
possible."</p>
<p>"Well what can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"Get an order from Sir William releasing
Dulcibel from prison."</p>
<p>"Oh, that I could! God knows how gladly I
would do it."</p>
<p>"You can at least try," said Master Raymond
desperately.</p>
<p>The lady hesitated a moment. "Yes, as
you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg
372]</a></span> say, I can at least try. But you know how
impossible it is to carry on the government of this Province
without the support of the ministers and the magistrates. Sir
William is naturally anxious to succeed; for, if he fails here, it
will block his road to further preferment."</p>
<p>"And he will allow the shedding of innocent
blood to go on, in order to promote his own selfish ambition?" said
the young man indignantly.</p>
<p>"You are unjust to the Governor. He will do
all he can to moderate this fanaticism; and, if it comes to the
worst, he will order a general jail-delivery, and meet the
consequences. But he hopes much from time, and from such
developments as those of your chicken feathers"&mdash;and the lady
smiled at the thought of the minister's discomfiture.</p>
<p>"Some things can wait, but I cannot wait,"
insisted Master Raymond. "You must acknowledge that."</p>
<p>"Sir William starts this afternoon on a visit
to Plymouth, to remain for a day or so; but I will have a talk with
him, and see what I can do," replied the lady. "Call here again at
six o'clock this evening."</p>
<p>"Such beauty and spirit as yours must
be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg
373]</a></span> irresistible in the cause of virtue and innocence,"
said the young man, rising to depart.</p>
<p>"No flattery, Master Raymond; I will do all I
can without that;" but Lady Mary being still a very comely woman,
as she certainly was a very spirited one, was not much displeased
at the compliment, coming from such a handsome young man as Master
Raymond. Eulogy that the hearer hopes embodies but the simple
truth, is always pleasant alike to men and women. It is falsehood,
and not truth, that constitutes the essence of Flattery.</p>
<p>The day dragged on very drearily and slowly
to Master Raymond. The waiting for the hour of action is so
irksome, that even the approach of danger is a relief. But patience
will at last weary out the slowest hours; and punctually at six
o'clock, the young man stood again at the door of the Governor's
mansion.</p>
<p>Lady Mary evidently was expecting
him&mdash;for he was shown in at once. She looked up wearily as he
entered. "I can do nothing to-day," she said.</p>
<p>"What ground did the Governor
take?"</p>
<p>"That sound policy forbade him to move in the
matter at present. The persecuting party were<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> very
indignant at the escape of Captain Alden and the Englishes; and now
for him to grant a pardon to another of the accused, would be to
irritate them to madness."</p>
<p>Master Raymond acknowledged to himself the
soundness of the Governor's policy; but he only said: "Then it
seems that Dulcibel must go back to Salem prison; and I run a good
chance of going to prison also, as a self-confessed deceiver and
impostor."</p>
<p>"If she were released, could you both get
away from Boston&mdash;at once?"</p>
<p>Master Raymond's voice sank to a whisper. "I
have all my plans arranged. By the third hour after midnight, we
shall be where we can snap our fingers at the magistrates of
Boston."</p>
<p>"I have been thinking of a plan. It may
work&mdash;or may not. But it is worth trying."</p>
<p>The young man's face lightened.</p>
<p>"You know that England is ruled by William
and Mary, why should not the Province of Massachusetts also
be?"</p>
<p>"I do not understand you."</p>
<p>"Upon leaving Sir William, I was somewhat
indignant that he would not grant my request. And to pacify me, he
said he was sorry that I had<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span> not the same share in
the government here, that Queen Mary had at home&mdash;and then I
could do more as I pleased."</p>
<p>Still Master Raymond's face showed that he
was puzzled to catch her meaning.</p>
<p>She laughed and rose from her chair; the old,
resolute expression upon her spirited face, and, opening the door
into the next room, which was the Governor's private office, she
said:</p>
<p>"Come here a moment, Master
Josslyn."</p>
<p>The private Secretary entered.</p>
<p>"Prepare me," she said to the Secretary, "the
proper paper, to be signed by the Governor, ordering Keeper Arnold
to release at once Mistress Dulcibel Burton from confinement in the
Boston Bridewell."</p>
<p>"But the Governor, you know, is absent, Lady
Mary," said the Secretary, "and his signature will be
necessary."</p>
<p>"Oh, I will see to that," replied the lady a
little haughtily.</p>
<p>Master Raymond sat quietly&mdash;waiting for
what was to come next. He could not conceive how Lady Mary intended
to manage it. As for the lady, she tapped the table with her
shapely fingers impatiently.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>
<p>In a few minutes Master Josslyn reappeared
with the paper. "All it now wants is the signature of the
Governor," said he.</p>
<p>The lady took up a pen from the table by
which she was sitting, and filled it with ink; then with a firm
hand she signed the paper, "William Phips, Governor, by Lady Mary
Phips."</p>
<p>"But, your ladyship, the keeper will not
acknowledge the validity of that signature, or obey it," said
Master Josslyn in some alarm.</p>
<p>"He will not? We shall see!" responded her
ladyship rising. "Order my carriage, Master Josslyn."</p>
<p>In fifteen minutes, Lady Mary, accompanied by
Master Raymond, was at Keeper Arnold's house.</p>
<p>"I bring you good news, Master Arnold," said
Lady Mary, "I know you will rejoice, such a tender-hearted man as
you are at the release of Mistress Dulcibel Burton. Here is the
official document." She flourished it at him, but still kept it in
her hand.</p>
<p>Dulcibel was soon informed of the good news;
and came flying out to meet her benefactor and her
lover.</p>
<p>"Put on a shawl and your veil at once;
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg
377]</a></span> make a bundle of your belongings," said Lady Mary,
kissing her. "Master Raymond is in a great hurry to carry you
off&mdash;at which I confess that I do not wonder." Dulcibel
tripped off&mdash;the sooner she was out of that close place the
better.</p>
<p>"Well, what is it, Master Arnold?" said Lady
Mary to the keeper, who acted as if he wished to say
something.</p>
<p>"It is only a form, my lady; but you have not
shown me the Governor's warrant yet?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes I have," said Lady Mary, fluttering
it at him as before.</p>
<p>But Keeper Arnold was fully aware of the
responsibility of his position; and putting out his hand, he
steadied the fluttering paper sufficiently to glance over its
contents. When he came to the signature, his face paled. "Pardon
me, my lady; but this is not the Governor's writing."</p>
<p>"Of course it is not&mdash;why, you silly
loon, how could it be when he has gone to Plymouth? But you will
perceive that it is in Master Josslyn's writing&mdash;and the
Governor ought to have signed it before he started."</p>
<p>"This is hardly in regular form, my
lady."</p>
<p>"It is not? Do you not see the
Governor's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id=
"Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span> name; and there below it is my name,
as proof of the Governor's. Do you mean to impeach my attestation
of Sir William's signature? There is my name, Lady Mary Phips: and
I will take the responsibility of this paper being a legal one. If
anybody finds fault with you, send him to me; and I will say you
did it, in the Governor's absence from town, at my peremptory
order." The lady's face glowed, and her eyes flashed, with her
excitement and determination.</p>
<p>"It would be as much as my position is worth
to disobey it and me!" rejoined Lady Mary. "I will have you out of
this place in three days' time, if you cast disrespect upon my
written name."</p>
<p>"There can be no great haste in this matter.
Bring the release tomorrow, and I will consult authority in the
meanwhile," said the keeper pleadingly.</p>
<p>"Authority? The Governor's name is authority!
I am authority! Who dare you set up beside us? You forget your
proper respect and duty, Master Arnold."</p>
<p>The keeper was overborne at last. "You will
uphold me, if I do this thing, Lady Mary?" said he
imploringly.</p>
<p>"You know me, Master Arnold&mdash;and that
I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg
379]</a></span> never desert my friends! I shall accept the full
responsibility of this deed before Sir William and the magistrates.
And they cannot order any punishment which he cannot
pardon."</p>
<p>By this time it had grown quite dark. "Shall
I take you anywhere in my carriage?" said Lady Mary, as Dulcibel
reappeared with a bundle.</p>
<p>"It is not necessary," replied Master Raymond
joyfully, "I will not compromise you any further. God forever bless
your ladyship! There is not another woman in New England with the
spirit and courage to do what you have done this day&mdash;and the
reader of our history a hundred years to come, as he reads this
page, shall cry fervently, God bless the fearless and generous soul
of Lady Mary!"</p>
<p>"Let me know when you are safe," she
whispered to the young man, as he stood by her carriage. "Master
and Mistress English are now the guests of Governor Fletcher of New
York&mdash;changing a Boston prison for a Governor's mansion. You
will be perfectly secure in that Province&mdash;or in Pennsylvania,
or Maryland or Virginia." And the carriage drove off.</p>
<p>It was in that early hour of the evening,
when the streets in town and city, are more deserted
than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg
380]</a></span> they are for some hours afterwards; everyone being
indoors, and not come out for visiting or amusement. And so the
young man and his companion walked towards the north-eastern part
of the town, meeting only one or two persons, who took no special
notice of them.</p>
<p>"You do not ask where we are going,
Dulcibel?" at last said Master Raymond.</p>
<p>She could not see the sweet smile on his
face; but she could feel it in his voice.</p>
<p>"Anywhere, with you!" the maiden replied in a
low tone.</p>
<p>"We are going to be married."</p>
<p>He felt the pressure of her hand upon his arm
in response.</p>
<p>"That is, if we can find a minister to
perform the ceremony."</p>
<p>"That will be difficult, I should
think."</p>
<p>"Yes, difficult, but not impossible. After
getting you out of prison, as Lady Mary did, I should not like to
call anything impossible."</p>
<p>"Lady Mary is an angel!"</p>
<p>"Yes, one of the kind with wings," replied
her companion laughing. "She has kindly loaned us her wings
though&mdash;and we are flying away on them."<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg
381]</a></span></p>
<p>Before long they were at one of the wharves;
then on a small boat&mdash;then on the deck of the "Storm
King."</p>
<p>"I am better than my word, Captain
Tolley."</p>
<p>"Aye! indeed you are. And this is the birdie!
Fair Mistress, the "Storm King" and his brood are ready to die to
shield you from harm."</p>
<p>Dulcibel looked wonder out of her clear blue
eyes. What did it all mean? She smiled at the Captain's devoted
speech. "I do not want any one to die for me, Captain. I would
rather have you sing me a good sea-song, such as my father, who was
also a sea-captain, used to delight me with at home."</p>
<p>"Oh, we can do that too," answered the
Captain gaily. "I hope we shall have a jolly time of it, before we
reach our destination. Now, come down into the cabin and see the
preparations I have made for you; a sailor's daughter must have the
best of sailor's cheer."</p>
<p>"One word, Captain," said Master Raymond, as
the Captain came up on deck again, leaving Dulcibel to the privacy
of her state-room. "It does not seem fitting that a young unmarried
woman should be alone on a vessel like this, with no matron to bear
her company."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id=
"Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sir!" said the Captain, "I would have you
know that the maiden is as safe from aught that could offend her
modesty on the decks of the "Storm King," as if she were in her
father's house."</p>
<p>"Of course she is. I know that well&mdash;and
mean not the least offense. And she, innocent as she is, has no
other thought. But this is a slanderous world, Captain, and we men
who know the world, must think for her."</p>
<p>"Oh, I admit that," said Captain Tolley,
somewhat mollified, "we cannot expect of mere land's people, who
put an innocent girl like that into prison for no offense, the
gentle behavior towards women that comes naturally from a seaman;
but what do you propose?"</p>
<p>"To send for one of the Boston ministers, and
marry her before we leave port."</p>
<p>"Why, of course," replied the Captain. "It is
the very thing. Whom shall we send for? The North Church is
nearest&mdash;how would Master Cotton Mather do?"</p>
<p>The young man stood thoughtfully silent for a
moment or two. The ministers of South Church and of King's chapel
were more heterodox in all this witchcraft business; but for that
very reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id=
"Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> he did not wish to compromise them
in any way. Besides, he owed a grudge to Master Mather, for his
general course in sustaining the persecution, and his recent
language in particular towards himself. So his lips gradually
settled into a stern determination, and he replied "Master Mather
is the very man."</p>
<p>"It may require a little ingenuity to get him
aboard at this time of the evening," said the Captain. "But I
reckon my first mate, Simmons, can do it, if any one
can."</p>
<p>"Here, Simmons," to the first mate, who was
standing near, "you look like a pillar of the church, go ashore and
bring off Master Cotton Mather with you. A wealthy young Englishman
is dying&mdash;and he cannot pass away from Boston in peace without
his ministerial services."</p>
<p>"Dying?" ejaculated Master
Raymond.</p>
<p>"Yes, dying! dying to get married&mdash;and
you cannot pass out of Boston harbor in peace, without his
ministerial services."</p>
<p>"Would it not do as well to ask him to come
and marry us?"</p>
<p>"I doubt it," replied the Captain. "Master
Mather is honest in his faith, even if he is bigoted and
superstitious&mdash;and death cannot be put off<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> like
marriage till tomorrow. But take your own course,
Simmons&mdash;only bring him."</p>
<p>"Shall I use force, sir, if he will not come
peaceably?" asked the mate coolly.</p>
<p>"Not if it will make a disturbance," said his
commander. "We do not want to run the gauntlet of the castle's guns
as we go out of the harbor. The wind is hardly lively enough for
that."</p>
<p>"I will go down and tell Dulcibel," said
Master Raymond. "It is rather sudden, but she is a maiden of great
good sense, and will see clearly the necessity of the case. And as
she is an orphan, she has no father or mother whose consent she
might consider necessary. But Mate"&mdash;going to the side of the
vessel, which the boat was just leaving, "not a word as to my name
or that of the maiden. That would spoil all."</p>
<p>"Aye, aye, sir! Trust me to bring him!" and
the boat started for the shore, under the vigorous strokes of two
oarsmen.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h2>CHAPTER LII.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id=

<h4>An Unwilling Parson.</h4>
<p>Not quite an hour had elapsed, when the sound
of oars was again heard; and Captain Tolley, peering through the
dark, saw that another form was seated opposite the mate in the
stern-sheets of the boat.</p>
<p>"I thought that Simmons would bring him,"
said Captain Tolley to the second mate; "such a smooth tongue as he
has. It is a pity he wasn't a minister himself&mdash;his genius is
half wasted here."</p>
<p>"Glad to see you on board the Storm King,
Master Mather," was the greeting of the Captain, as the minister
was helped up to the deck by the mates.</p>
<p>"The Storm King! Why I was told that it was
an English frigate, just come into port," said the minister in a
surprised voice.</p>
<p>"The messenger must have made a mistake,"
replied the Captain coolly. "You know that landsmen always do get
things mixed.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id=
"Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>"Well, as I am here, no matter. Show
me the dying man."</p>
<p>"Walk down into the cabin," said the Captain
politely.</p>
<p>Entering the cabin which was well lighted,
Master Raymond stepped forward, "I am happy to see you, Master
Mather. You remember me, do you not?"</p>
<p>"Master Raymond, I believe," returned the
minister coldly. "Where is the dying man who requires my spiritual
ministrations?"</p>
<p>"Dying!" laughed the Captain. "How strangely
that fellow got things mixed. I said dying to get married&mdash;did
I not, Master Raymond?"</p>
<p>"Of course you did&mdash;that is, after you
had explained yourself."</p>
<p>Master Mather's face looked blank, he did not
know what to make of it.</p>
<p>"In truth, Master Mather," said the young
Englishman, "I was under the necessity of getting married this
evening; and, thinking over the worshipful ministers of Boston
town, I singled you out as the one I should prefer to officiate on
the happy occasion."</p>
<p>"I decline to have anything to do with it,"
said Master Mather indignantly, turning on his heel, and going to
the door of the cabin. But here a muscular sailor, with a boarding
pike, promptly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id=
"Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> forbade his passage by putting the
pike across the door way.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by barring my way in this
manner?" said the minister in great wrath to the captain. "Have you
no reverence for the law?"</p>
<p>"Not a particle for Boston law," replied
Captain Tolley. "The only law recognized on board the Storm King is
the command of its Captain. You have been brought here to marry
these two young friends of mine; and you will not leave the vessel
before you do it&mdash;if I have to take you with us all the way to
China."</p>
<p>Master Mather pondered the matter for a
moment. "This is too informal, there are certain preliminaries that
are necessary in such cases."</p>
<p>"Advisable&mdash;but I am told not absolutely
necessary," replied Master Raymond.</p>
<p>"Wait then for an hour or two; and we shall
be on the high seas&mdash;and out of any jurisdiction," added
Captain Tolley.</p>
<p>"Who is this maiden? Who gives her away?"
asked the minister.</p>
<p>"This maiden is Mistress Dulcibel Burton,"
said Master Raymond, taking her by the hand.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id=
"Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>"She is an orphan; but I give her
away," added the Captain.</p>
<p>"Dulcibel Burton! the serpent witch!"
exclaimed Master Mather. "What is that convict doing here? Has she
broken jail?"</p>
<p>"Master Mather," said the Captain in an
excited tone, "if you utter another word of insult against this
innocent and beautiful maiden, I will have you flung overboard to
the sharks! So take care of what you say!" and the indignant seaman
shook his finger in the minister's face warningly.</p>
<p>"Master Mather," added Raymond, more coolly,
"Mistress Burton has not broken jail. She was duly released from
custody by Keeper Arnold on the presentation of an official paper
by Lady Mary Phips. Therefore your conscience need not be uneasy on
that score."</p>
<p>"Why are you here then&mdash;why making this
haste? It is evident that there is something wrong about
it."</p>
<p>"Boston has not treated either of us so well
that we are very desirous of remaining," replied Master Raymond.
"And as we are going together, it is only decorous that we should
get married. If you however refuse to marry us, we shall be
compelled to take you with us&mdash;for the mere presence of such a
respected minister will be sufficient to<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
shield the maiden's name from all reckless
calumniators."</p>
<p>The second mate came to the door of the
cabin. "Captain, there is a fine breeze blowing, it is a pity not
to use it."</p>
<p>"Make all ready, sir," replied the Captain.
Then turning to the minister, "There is no particular hurry, Master
Mather. You can take the night to think over it. To-morrow morning
probably, if you come to your senses, we may be able to send you
ashore somewhere, between here and the capes of the
Delaware."</p>
<p>"This is outrageous!" said Master Mather. "I
will hold both of you accountable for it."</p>
<p>"It is a bad time to threaten, when your head
is in the lion's mouth, Master Mather," returned Captain Tolley
fiercely. "No one knows but my own men that you ever came on board
the 'Storm King.' How do you know that I am not Captain Kidd
himself?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id=
"Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>The minister's face grew pale. It was
no disparagement to his manhood. Even Master Raymond's face grew
very serious&mdash;for did even he know that this Captain Tolley
might not be the renowned freebooter, of whose many acts of daring
and violence the wide seas rang?</p>
<p>"I would counsel you for your own good to do
at once what you will have to do ultimately," said Master Raymond
gravely. "I owe you no thanks for anything; but"&mdash;and the
young man laughed as he turned to Dulcibel&mdash;"I never could
trap even a fox without pitying the animal."</p>
<p>Dulcibel went up to the minister, and put her
hand upon his arm:&mdash;"Do I look so much like a witch?" she said
in a playful tone.</p>
<p>"We are told that Satan can enrobe himself
like an angel of light," replied Master Mather severely. "I judge
you by what I have heard of your cruel deeds."</p>
<p>"As you judged the cruel yellow bird that
turned out to be only a harmless little chicken," said Master
Raymond sarcastically. "Enough of this folly. Will you marry us
now&mdash;or not? If you will, you shall be put ashore unharmed. If
you will not, you shall go along with us. Make up your mind at
once, for we shall soon be out of Boston harbor."</p>
<p>Master Mather had a strong will&mdash;and an
equally strong won't&mdash;but the Philistines were, for this time,
too much for him. That reference to Captain Kidd had frightened him
badly. "Stand up&mdash;and I will marry you. Unscrupulous as
you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg
391]</a></span> both are, it is better that you should be married
by legal rites, than allowed to go your own way to
destruction."</p>
<p>And then&mdash;the important ceremony being
duly gone through&mdash;he pronounced Master Ellis Raymond and
Mistress Dulcibel Burton man and wife. The Captain being allowed by
Master Raymond to take the first kiss, as acting in the place of
the bride's father.</p>
<p>"No, not a penny!" said the minister, closing
his hand against the golden pieces that the groom held out to him.
"All I ask is, that you comply with your promise&mdash;and put me
on shore again as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"Better take a drink of wine first," said the
Captain, filling up a glass and handing it to him.</p>
<p>"I will neither break bread nor drink wine on
this"&mdash;he was going to say <i>accursed</i> ship; but the
fierce eyes of the possible freebooter were upon him, and he said,
"on this unhappy vessel."</p>
<p>Captain Tolley laughed heartily. "Oh well,
good wine never goes begging. The anchor is not up yet, and we will
put you off just where you came on. Come along!"</p>
<p>Without a word of leave-taking to the two
whom he had joined together, Master Mather followed<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> the
Captain. In fact though, Master Raymond and Dulcibel scarcely noted
his going, for they were now seated on a small sofa, the arm of the
young husband around the shapely waist of his newly-made wife, and
the minister dismissed from their minds as completely as the
wine-glass out of which they had just drank. He had answered their
purpose and in the deep bliss of their new relation, they thought
no more about him.</p>
<p>As Master Mather turned to descend to the
boat again&mdash;not wasting any formal words of leave-taking upon
the Captain either&mdash;the latter grasped him by the
arm.</p>
<p>"Wait one moment," said Captain Tolley. "You
will speak of what has occurred here this evening Master Mather, or
not, at your pleasure. But be careful of what you say&mdash;for
there is no power on this coast, strong enough to protect you
against my vengeance!" And with a scowl upon his face, that would
not have done injustice to the dreaded Captain Kidd himself, he
added in a hoarse, fierce tone the one impressive word
"Beware!"</p>
<p>The minister made no reply. It was a day of
fierce men and wild deeds&mdash;especially on the high<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
seas. Prudence in some positions is far better than
valor.</p>
<p>"Now, my hearties! let us get out of this
harbor as soon as possible!" cried the Captain. "I might have held
him till we were opposite the castle, and put him ashore there; but
it is safer as it is. We have a regular clearance, and he cannot do
anything legally under an hour or two at least&mdash;while in
half-an-hour we shall be outside. With a stiff breeze like this,
once on the open seas, I fear neither man nor devil!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id=
"Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
<h4>The Wedding Trip and Where Then.</h4>
<p>Whether Master Mather did make any serious
effort to prevent the "Storm King" from leaving the harbor, I am
unable to say; but as I find no reference to this affair either in
his biography or his numerous works, I am inclined to think that
like a wise man, he held his peace as to what had occurred, and
resolved never to go on board another vessel after
nightfall.</p>
<p>Certainly no cannon ball cut the waves as the
"Storm King" sailed swiftly past the castle, and no signal was
displayed signifying that she must come at once to
anchor.</p>
<p>And the little trip to New York was as
pleasant in all respects as a young couple on a bridal tour could
desire&mdash;even if the mere relief from the anxieties and
threatened dangers of the previous long months had not been of
itself a cause of happiness.</p>
<p>Arrived at New York, Master Philip English
and his wife received them with open arms. Master Raymond had
brought letters from England to Governor Fletcher and others, and
soon made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg
395]</a></span> warm friends among the very best people. There was
no sympathy whatever in New York at that time with the witchcraft
persecutions in Massachusetts; and all fugitives were received, as
in the case of the Englishes, with great sympathy and
kindness.</p>
<p>Much to my regret, at this point, the old
manuscript book to which I have been so largely indebted, suddenly
closes its record of the fortunes of Master and Mistress Raymond.
Whether they went to England, and took up their residence there
among Master Raymond's friends, or found a home in this new world,
I am therefore not able with absolute certainty to say. From what I
have been able, however, to gather from other quarters, I have come
to the conclusion that they were so much pleased with their
reception in New York, that Master Raymond purchased an estate on
the east side of the Hudson River, where he and the charming
Dulcibel lived and loved to a good old age, leaving three sons and
three daughters. If this couple really were our hero and heroine,
then the Raymonds became connected, through the three daughters,
with the Smiths, the Joneses and the Browns. In one way, perhaps,
the question might be set at rest, were it not too
delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg
396]</a></span> a one for successful handling. There is little
doubt that among the descendants of Mistress Dulcibel, on the
female side, the birth-mark of the serpent, more or less distinct,
will be found occasionally occurring, even now, at the lapse of
almost two centuries. Therefore, if among the secret traditions of
any of the families I have mentioned, there be one relative to this
curious birth-mark, doubtless that would be sufficient proof that
in their veins runs the rich blood of the charming Dulcibel
Raymond.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIV.</h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id=
"Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
<h4>Some Concluding Remarks.</h4>
<p>Perhaps before I conclude I should state that
the keeper of the Boston Bridewell, Master Arnold, was summarily
dismissed for accepting the validity of the Governor's signature.
But he did not take it very grievously to heart for Master Raymond,
Captain Alden and others whom he had obliged saw him largely
recompensed. Captain Alden, by the way, had fled for concealment to
his relatives in Duxbury. Being asked when he appeared there,
"Where he came from?" the old captain said "he was fleeing from the
devil&mdash;who was still after him." However his relatives managed
to keep him safely, until all danger was passed, both from the
devil and from his imps.</p>
<p>As for Lady Mary, the indignation of "the
faithful" was hot against her&mdash;and finally against Sir
William, who could not be made to see in it anything but a very
good joke. "You know that Lady Mary will have her own way," he said
to Master Mather.</p>
<p>"Wives should be kept in due gospel
subjection!" returned the minister.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, yes, rejoined the Governor smiling; but
I wish you had a wife like Lady Mary, and would try it on her! I
think we should hear something breaking."</p>
<p>But when Mistress Ann Putnam and others began
"to cry out" against Lady Mary as a witch, the Governor waxed angry
in his turn.</p>
<p>"It is time to put a stop to all this," he
said indignantly. "They will denounce me as a witch next." So he
issued a general pardon and jail delivery&mdash;alike to the ten
persons who were then under sentence of death, to those who had
escaped from prison, and to the one hundred and fifty lying in
different jails, and the two hundred others who had been denounced
for prosecution.</p>
<p>It was a fair blow, delivered at the very
front and forehead of the cruel persecution and it did its good
work, though it lost Sir William his position&mdash;sending him
back to England to answer the charges of his enemies, and to die
there soon afterwards in his forty-fifth year.</p>
<p>When Chief-Justice Stoughton, engaged in
fresh trials against the reputed witches, read the Governor's
proclamation of Pardon, he was so indignant that he left his seat
on the bench, and could not be prevailed upon to return to
it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg
399]</a></span></p>
<p>Neither could he, to the day of his death, be
brought to see that he had done anything else than what was right
in the whole matter.</p>
<p>Not so the jury&mdash;which, several years
after, confessed its great mistake, and publicly asked forgiveness.
Nor Judge Sewall, who rose openly in church, and confessed his
fault, and afterward kept one of the days of execution, with every
returning year, sacred to repentance and prayer&mdash;seeing no
person from sunrise to nightfall, mourning in the privacy of his
own room the sin he had committed.</p>
<p>Mistress Ann Putnam and her husband both died
within the seven years, as Dulcibel in her moment of spiritual
exaltation had predicted. Her daughter Ann lived to make a public
confession, asking pardon of those whom she had (she said
unintentionally) injured, and died at the age of
thirty-five&mdash;her grave being one that nobody wanted their
loved ones to lie next to.</p>
<p>As for the majority of the "afflicted
circle," they fell as the years went on into various evil
ways&mdash;one authority describing them as "abandoned to open and
shameless vice."</p>
<p>Master Philip English, after the issue of the
Governor's pardon, returned to Salem. Seven<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>teen
years afterwards, he was still trying to recover his property from
the officials of the Province. Of &pound;1500 seized, he never
recovered more than &pound;300; while his wife died in two years,
at the age of forty-two, in consequence of the treatment to which
she had been subjected.</p>
<p>Master Joseph Putnam and his fair Elizabeth
lived on in peace at the old place; taking into his service the
Quaker Antipas upon his release from prison. The latter was always
quiet and peaceful, save when any allusion was made to the witches.
But he had easy service and good treatment; and was a great
favorite with the children, especially with that image of his
father, who afterwards became distinguished as the Major General
Putnam of Revolutionary fame.</p>
<p>As for the presents that had been promised to
the "afflicted circle," they came to them duly, and from London
too. And they were rich gifts also; but such a collection of odd
and grotesque articles, certainly are not often got together.
Master Raymond had commissioned an eccentric friend of his in
London to purchase them, and send them on; acquainting him with the
peculiar circumstances. There were yellow birds, and red dragons,
and other fantastic animals, birds and beasts. But<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span> they
came from London and the "circle" found them just suited to their
peculiar tastes; and they always maintained, even in defiance of
Mistress Ann, that Master Raymond was a lovely gentleman and an
"afflicted" person himself. It will thus be seen that these Salem
maidens were in their day truly esthetic&mdash;having that
sympathetic fondness for unlovely and repulsive things, which is
the unerring indication of a daughter of Lilith.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' size="6" />
<p>And now, in conclusion, some one may ask,
"Did the Province of Massachusetts ever make any suitable atonement
for the great wrongs her Courts of Injustice had committed?" I
answer Never! Massachusetts has never made any, adequate
atonement&mdash;no, not to this day!</p>
<p>The General Assembly, eighteen years
afterwards, did indeed pass an act reversing the convictions and
attainders in all but six of the cases; and ordering the
distribution of the paltry sum of &pound;578 among the heirs of
twenty-four persons, as a kind of compensation to the families of
those who had suffered; but this was all&mdash;nothing, or next to
nothing!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id=
"Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>Perhaps the day will some time come,
when the cry of innocent blood from the rocky platform of Witch
Hill, shall swell into sufficient volume to be heard across the
chasm of two centuries. Then, on some high pedestal, where the
world can see it, Massachusetts shall proclaim in enduring marble
her penitence and ask a late forgiveness of the twenty innocent men
and women whom she so terribly wronged. And as all around, and even
the mariner far out at sea, shall behold the gleaming shaft,
standing where stood the rude gallows of two centuries ago, they
shall say with softening eyes and glowing cheeks: "It is never too
late to right a great wrong; and Massachusetts now makes all the
expiation that is possible to those whom her deluded forefathers
dishonored and persecuted and slew!"</p>
